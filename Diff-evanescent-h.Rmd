The word "evanescent" means, "lasting for only a short time, then disappearing quickly and being forgotten." ([Source](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/evanescent)) Another dictionary definition is "tending to vanish like vapor." ([Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evanescent)) I've used metaphors for $h$: tire irons, dramatic characters who never appear or speak. Here's another one: the solvent in ink or paint. Ink and paint are liquid yet become solid when brushed on a surface. This can happen because the solid pigments are suspended in liquid. Exposed to the air, the liquid vaporizes and is forgotten. The solid pigment remains on the surface.

We can easily evaluate an ***average rate of change function***, for instance ${\cal D}_t g(t)$ by evaluating $g(t)$ at two different inputs and dividing by the distance between the inputs:
$${\cal D}_t g(t) = \frac{g(t+h) - g(t)}{h}$$
So if you know $g()$, you know ${\cal D}_t g(t)$. By making $h$ very small, the "average" starts to look like "instantaneous." Over a small interval of length $h$, every smooth function looks like a straight line. For a straight line, the average rate of change is exactly the same as the instantaneous rate of change.

We'd like to take $h$ out of the picture, imagining that it is zero but not dealing with "divide by zero" if we can avoid it. To signify this idea of neglecting $h$, we'll use a new notation. Rather than ${\cal D}_t g(t)$ which has that pesky $h$ in it, we'll write $\partial_t g(t)$, using the lower-case $\partial$. The function $\partial_t g(t)$ can properly be called the ***instantaneous rate of change*** of $g(t)$. But everyone calls it the ***derivative of $g(t)$ with respect to $t$***  Many people leave out the "with respect to" part, which I suppose is fine for a function like $g(t)$ which has only one input. But functions constructed in modeling generally have multiple inputs, so it's a bad habit to neglect to identify which one the derivative is "with respect to." We'll always sneak the "with respect to" by putting the little subscript on $\partial_t$.

We lose something by letting $h$ vaporize. There is an easy formula for ${\cal D}_t g(t)$, but without $h$ we can't write down such a formula for the derivative. Mathematicians like to bridge the gap between ${\cal D}$ and $\partial$, that is between average and instantaneous rates of change, by writing the formula for the derivative with a little "caution" sign out front.
$$\partial_t g(t) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{g(t+h) - g(t)}{h}$$
The caution sign is mysterious to newcomers because it is saying something absurd: "Remember to forget $h$."

There are people who do actual calculations with $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}$ but nobody needs to any more unless they invent a brand-new function that can't be written with existing functions. If you do happen to invent such a brand-new function, please remember that you should also invent the derivative of that function. Fortunately for us, the inventors of the past have done the work for us.
