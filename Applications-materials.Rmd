EXERCISE:

In Section \@ref(function-composition) you saw a function giving the declination of the sun as a function of day of year, and length-of-day as a function of latitude and sun's declination. Putting these together let's us assemble day-length as a function of latitude and day of year.

Give function. DRAW CONTOUR PLOT, take slices. Day length as seen by a migrating bird. [Plug in a simple sinusoid for latitude to reduce the function to day-length versus day-of-year.]
