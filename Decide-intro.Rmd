# (PART) Decisions with calculus {.unnumbered}

# Simple Comparisons and reductions (NPV and expected value)

    Objectives:

    i. (Close-4a) Recognize two important real-world contexts in which a vector (or function) output applies:
        a. A cash-flow stream, and
        b. A probability distribution for an outcome
    #. (Close-4b) Employ Net Present Value (NPV) and Expected Value to convert vector outputs into a scalar for the purposes of optimization
    #. (Close-4c) Compute the NPV of a cash flow stream
    #. (Close-4d) Determine the expected value based on a discrete/continuous probability distribution function
    #. (Close-4e) Compute the expected value of a cash flow stream discounting to the NPV

7. **Multiobjective optimization**

    Objectives:

    i. (Close-7a) Be able to recognize situations where there is more than one objective to be achieved simultaneously.
    #. (Close-7b) Understand that in a multi-objective environment, a “best” solution is not always possible
