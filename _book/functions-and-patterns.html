</h1>
<p>As you know, a function takes one or more inputs and returns a value as output. The functions we examine in CalcZ take <em>quantities</em> as inputs and return a <em>quantity</em> as an output.
The algorithm that forms the body of the function describes arithmetic and other calculations that can turn the inputs into the output.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also use <strong><em>tables</em></strong> as functions. With a table, you specify the input, look up that input in one of the colums of the table which brings you to the right row. Then read out from that row the value in another column to be the output. The quantitative operation needed for table lookup is simple comparison. The floor/corridor/door metaphor describes table lookup as well as function evaluation.</p>
<p>In the previous block, we constructed functions to represent the patterns seen in data. In one example, we constructed a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t) = A + B e^{-k t}\)</span> to represent the temperature of water cooling in a mug as a function of time. In another example, we summarized the pattern of rising and falling tides.</p>
<p>It’s common sense that data is stored in tables. But we could easily represent any smooth mathematical function, such as our basic modeling functions, as a table look-up problem. Indeed, in the era before computers, many mathematical functions were used in exactly this manner: a printed table in which a person could search for a match to the input and retrieve a value for the output.</p>
<p>[Picture of some nice old table.]</p>
<p>In the computer era, we still routinely represent functions this way: data stored in computer files. For instance, an MP3 file is not much more than a sequence of numbers that record a complicated function of time: the air pressure variations of sound. Similarly, digital images record functions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> over a limited domain. Given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as input, you can look up the output by going to the right pixel.</p>
<p>We humans of course, don’t perceive the numerical output of either sound or image functions: we <strong>hear</strong> a sound and we <strong>see</strong> an image. We’ve got special biological equipment for this!</p>
<p>Consider the image in Figure @ref{fig:sand-1}. It is a picture of some indentations in a small area of sand, about two inches wide in the middle of a hiking trail. The dots are individual grains of sand.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="www/sand-furrows.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Can you see three almost parallel furrows? How about the small crater in the upper left?</p>
<p>You can see the individual grains of sand because they contrast sharply with their neighbors. Or, more precisely, you can see a few dozen grains <strong>because</strong> they contrast sharply with their neighbors.</p>
<p>You can think of the surface of the sand as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. It’s lower in some places and higher in others. But, in fact, you can’t see the height of an individual point in the photograph. In the right light, you wouldn’t notice the furrows at all. But the way the picture is lighted, raking sunlight from the left, the surface is translated into broad regions of brightness and shadow. In the light regions, the surface slants toward the sun. In the shadows, the surface slants away from the sun.</p>
<p>What you’re mainly seeing in the photo is the <strong><em>slant</em></strong> or <strong><em>slope</em></strong> of the surface. The light has transformed <em>elevation</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> into <em>slant</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and then encoded the slant as brightness, in much the same way the background of a contour plot encodes the output of the function as a color.</p>
<p>The moral here is that sometimes the data in a function is not in the right form for us to extract useful information. But by transforming that data to represent contrast or difference or slope, the information can be revealed.</p>
<p>This Block is about transforming functions to show difference and slope. Such transformation, accomplished by mathematics rather than the raking light of the sun, can take a pattern that we’re presented with and turn it into another pattern that can tell us what we want to know.</p>

<p>At the core of what we will do in this block to represent a function <strong><em>locally</em></strong> as a straight-line function. For instance, the exponential function has a curving shape. But let’s look what happens when we zoom in on the function in different local domains.</p>

<li>
<strong>[Deriv-2a]</strong> <em>Understand that specifying two different inputs to a function defines an input. The length of that interval between the “run”. The “rise” is the difference in output at the two input points. calculating a “rise over run” as a ratio gives the </em><strong>average rate of change</strong>* of a function over the interval*</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Comparing the value of a function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> at two inputs is a matter of evaluating the function at two inputs, say <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>. Often, our interest is in comparing the output at two <strong><em>nearby</em></strong> inputs. To convey this idea of nearby, we can write the two nearby inputs as <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_0 + h\)</span>. The lower-case letter <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> will be used throughout these notes to signify a <strong><em>small</em></strong> increment, typically positive, in the input to a function. (Note: The function <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> is not necessarily about small increments. It’s just a generic pronoun for a function.)</p>
<p>The <strong><em>finite difference</em></strong> between function outputs at the two nearby inputs is <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)\)</span>. We could just as well consider <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0) - f(x_0 - h)\)</span>. Are these two differences the same? That depends on the function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Consider the simple A/B combination of a power-law function and a constant function: <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv x^2 + 3\)</span>. Taking <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to be 0.1 and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> to be 1, what is the finite difference of <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>? How about for <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span>?</p>
<p>The finite difference is <span class="math display">\[g(x_0 + h) - g(x_0) = (x_0 + h)^2 + 3 - \left(x_0^2 + 3\right)\]</span>
When <span class="math inline">\(h=1\)</span> this gives <span class="math display">\[1.1^2 + 3 - (1.1 +3) = 1.21 - 1.1 = 0.21\]</span> When <span class="math inline">\(h=1.01\)</span> it is <span class="math display">\[1.01^2 - 1.01 = 1.0201 - 1.01 = 0.0101\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>We will often need to consider the finite difference as a function. This involves making a tiny change in notation. Instead of <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, which by our notation convention suggests a <em>specific value</em> for the input, we’ll write <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as in <span class="math display">\[f(x+h) - f(x)\]</span></p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Continuing the previous example … What is the finite difference function for <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>? Evaluate it at <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span></p>
<p>The formula, as we have seen, is <span class="math display">\[(x+h)^2 + 3 - \left(x^2 + 3\right) = x^2 + 2h x + h^2 + 3 - (x^2 + 3) = 2h x + h^2\]</span></p>
<p>Evaluating this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span> the finite difference function evaluates to <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.1 \times 1 + 0.1^2 = 0.2 + 0.01 = 0.21\)</span>.</li>
<li>Setting <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.01 \times 1 + 0.01^2 = 0.0201\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At <span class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span> the finite difference function evaluates to <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.1 \times 2 + 0.1^2 = 0.4 + 0.01 = 0.041\)</span>.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span>, it is <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.01 \times 2 + 0.01^2 = 0.0401\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the value of the finite difference function depends both on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> <em>and on</em> <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Not a surprize. When <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span> the values are roughly 10-times smaller than for <span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This idea of a <strong><em>finite-difference function</em></strong> is mainly just a step on the path to another kind of function that will be of primary importance in calculus, the <strong><em>finite rate of change</em></strong>, often called the <strong><em>average rate of change</em></strong>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span>
Recognize this as “rise over run,” in other words a “slope.”</p>
<p>Let’s give this particular function a name to help us talk about it. A tradition is to use a Greek letter, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> (“delta”), here. The finite rate of change function for <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\Delta f(x) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span> In computer notation, we might write <code>delta_f()</code>. Remember, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span> is just the <strong>name</strong> we’ve given to the function. Any other name could have been used.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Find the finite rate of change function for <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> and evaluate it at <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(h=0.1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span>.</p>
<p>Following the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> naming convention, we’ll call the finite rate of change function <span class="math display">\[\Delta g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} = \frac{2 h x + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h\]</span></p>
<p>Evaluating <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(1)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span>, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(h=0.10\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(2 + 0.10 = 2.10\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(h=0.01\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(2 + 0.01 = 2.01\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to the finite difference function, where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> strongly shapes the output, for the finite rate of change function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> hardly matters at all!</p>
</div>
<p>From the way we’ve defined <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f(x)\)</span>, it’s reasonable to assume that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a <strong><em>parameter</em></strong>: a symbol naming a numerical value that has to be specified before <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f(x)\)</span> can be evaluated at a specific <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> actually is a character in the play of calculus, a character that plays a central role but whose numerical value is usually of no interest whatsoever besides being “small.”</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>We said that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in the finite rate of change function <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g()\)</span>, so long as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is small, plays both a central role and has hardly any effect. An economizing director, re-writes the play to take <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> out of it, setting <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span>: a non-speaking role. With this choice, what’s <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(x)\)</span>?</p>
<p>We’ve already seen that <span class="math display">\[\Delta g(x) = 2 x + h\]</span> Re-writing by replacing <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> with 0 streamlines the play, turning <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g()\)</span> from a dialog into a monologue: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(x) = 2 x\)</span>. Simple.</p>
<p>And yet … the director gets a letter from the Actors Equity Union.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We observe that you have eliminated the role of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> from your play. This is in violation of Union regulations. Recall that a finite rate of change function <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(x)\)</span> is defined as a ratio: <span class="math display">\[\Delta g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}\]</span> Although the name <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> does not need to appear in the argument list of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(x)\)</span>, eliminating <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> entirely by replacing her with zero is a <strong>division by zero error</strong> forbidden by Article 3.16§B¶2 of the Unified Laws of Arithmetic. We ask that you comply with this Article by re-instating the role of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in all evaluations of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g(x)\)</span>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this, the director calls her lawyer. Is there a loophole to deal with Article 3.16§B¶2 without <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>?</p>

</h2>
<p>Up until now, we used only functions that take numerical quantities as inputs and produce a numerical quantity as an output. It’s time now to broaden our perspective a bit.</p>
<p>Imagine a function named <span class="math inline">\(\Delta()\)</span> defined like this:
<span class="math display">\[\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta()\)</span> takes as input a <strong>function</strong>. You might have guessed this because the definition uses the name <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> for the input to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta()\)</span>, but the name of an input does not matter so long as it is used consistently in the body of the function. Looking at the body, you can that the name <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is being used (twice!) in the position of a function’s name.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta(\sin) = \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta(x^2) = \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta(a + b x) = \frac{a + b(x + h) - \left(a + b x\right)}{h}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="why" latex-data="">
<p>Why did you use <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> in the above statements rather than the <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> means “is defined as” or “is the name of.” When we wrote <span class="math display">\[\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span> we were giving a name to a function. But writing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(a + b x)\)</span> means to apply the already defined function <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> to an input, that input being the straight-line function <span class="math inline">\(a + b x\)</span>. Rather than <em>defining</em> what is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(a + b x)\)</span> we are <em>deducing</em> it from objects that have already been defined.</p>
</div>
<p>What is the output of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta()\)</span>? It takes a <em>function</em> as an input and returns … a function as an output.</p>
<p>We might choose to give a name to the output, for example fred() or betty() or, more helpfully, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{rate}_\sin\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sin\)</span>, but our naming conventions, particularly the use of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> indicate that $ is a function.</p>
<p>In calculus, there are a handful of celebrity functions that take a function as input and return a function as output. Notice that the word “function” appeared three times in the previous sentence. To avoid this sort of sleep-inducing repetition, we’ll call such functions <strong><em>operators</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong><em>operator</em></strong> (as we will use the word) is a function that, like all functions, has an input and an output. The input is itself a function, the output is also a function, typically (but not always) different from the input.</p>
