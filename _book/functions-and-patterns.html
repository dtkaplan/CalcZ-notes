<p>As you know, a function takes one or more inputs and returns a value as output. The functions we examine in CalcZ take <em>quantities</em> as inputs and return a <em>quantity</em> as an output.
The algorithm that forms the body of the function describes arithmetic and other calculations that can turn the inputs into the output.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also use <strong><em>tables</em></strong> as functions. With a table, you specify the input, look up that input in one of the colums of the table which brings you to the right row. Then read out from that row the value in another column to be the output. The quantitative operation needed for table lookup is simple comparison. The floor/corridor/door metaphor describes table lookup as well as function evaluation.</p>
<p>In the previous block, we constructed functions to represent the patterns seen in data. In one example, we constructed a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t) = A + B e^{-k t}\)</span> to represent the temperature of water cooling in a mug as a function of time. In another example, we summarized the pattern of rising and falling tides.</p>
<p>It’s common sense that data is stored in tables. But we could easily represent any smooth mathematical function, such as our basic modeling functions, as a table look-up problem. Indeed, in the era before computers, many mathematical functions were used in exactly this manner: a printed table in which a person could search for a match to the input and retrieve a value for the output.</p>
<p>[Picture of some nice old table.]</p>
<p>In the computer era, we still routinely represent functions this way: data stored in computer files. For instance, an MP3 file is not much more than a sequence of numbers that record a complicated function of time: the air pressure variations of sound. Similarly, digital images record functions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> over a limited domain. Given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as input, you can look up the output by going to the right pixel.</p>
<p>We humans of course, don’t perceive the numerical output of either sound or image functions: we <strong>hear</strong> a sound and we <strong>see</strong> an image. We’ve got special biological equipment for this!</p>
<p>Consider the image in Figure @ref{fig:sand-1}. It is a picture of some indentations in a small area of sand, about two inches wide in the middle of a hiking trail. The dots are individual grains of sand.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="www/sand-furrows.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Can you see three almost parallel furrows? How about the small crater in the upper left?</p>
<p>You can see the individual grains of sand because they contrast sharply with their neighbors. Or, more precisely, you can see a few dozen grains <strong>because</strong> they contrast sharply with their neighbors.</p>
<p>You can think of the surface of the sand as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. It’s lower in some places and higher in others. But, in fact, you can’t see the height of an individual point in the photograph. In the right light, you wouldn’t notice the furrows at all. But the way the picture is lighted, raking sunlight from the left, the surface is translated into broad regions of brightness and shadow. In the light regions, the surface slants toward the sun. In the shadows, the surface slants away from the sun.</p>
<p>What you’re mainly seeing in the photo is the <strong><em>slant</em></strong> or <strong><em>slope</em></strong> of the surface. The light has transformed <em>elevation</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> into <em>slant</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and then encoded the slant as brightness, in much the same way the background of a contour plot encodes the output of the function as a color.</p>
<p>The moral here is that sometimes the data in a function is not in the right form for us to extract useful information. But by transforming that data to represent contrast or difference or slope, the information can be revealed.</p>
<p>This Block is about transforming functions to show difference and slope. Such transformation, accomplished by mathematics rather than the raking light of the sun, can take a pattern that we’re presented with and turn it into another pattern that can tell us what we want to know.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>[Deriv-2a]</strong> <em>Identify the “average rate of change” of a function over an interval as the overall change in output divided by the change in input.</em>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>As you know, one way to calculate the slope of a straight-line function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> is to pick two different values for the input: call the larger of them <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and the smaller <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Think of these input values as the endpoints of an <strong><em>interval</em></strong> or <strong><em>neighborhood</em></strong> of the domain. The length of this domain is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Evaluate the function at those endpoints and calculate the slope simply as the difference in output divided by the length of the interval: <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}\]</span></p>
<p>“Slope” is a natural metaphor when thinking of a function as a graph. But a more general way to describe the concept is the <strong><em>rate of change</em></strong> of the output with respect to the input. The change in the output from one end of the interval is <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1) - f(x_0)\)</span>, the change in the input is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0\)</span>. If the input is time (in hours), and the output is the position of a car (in miles), then the rate of change is <em>miles-per-hour</em>: the car’s velocity.</p>
<p>For a straight-line function—think of a car driving at constant speed on a highway—it doesn’t matter what you choose for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> (so long as they are not identical). But for other functions, the choice does matter.</p>
<p>Imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}. Over the course of an hour, the car travelled about 25 miles. In other words, the <strong><em>average</em></strong> speed is 25 miles/hour: the <em>slope</em> of the red line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car was stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D) and sometimes much faster than average (time B).</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/stop-and-go-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>During the interval from B to C, the car was travelling relatively fast. The slope of the brown segment connecting the position at times B and C is the <strong><em>average</em></strong> rate of change between times B and C. It’s easy to see that the average rate of change from B to C is larger than the overall average from <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span>. Calculating that slope is a matter of evaluating the position at the endpoints and dividing by the length of the interval.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>What is the average rate of change in the car’s position during the interval <span class="math inline">\(t_B = 0.40\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_C=0.54\)</span>?</p>
<p>The length of the interval is <span class="math inline">\(t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14\)</span>.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function gives <span class="math inline">\(x(t_C) = 18\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x(t_B) = 12.6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Rise is <span class="math inline">\(x(t_C) - x(t_B) = 18 - 12.6 = 5.4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Run is <span class="math inline">\(t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14\)</span>.</p>
<p>The average rate of change during the interval is $5.4/0.14 = 38.6 $ miles/hour.</p>

</div>
<p>The car’s speedometer shows the speed at each moment—or <strong><em>instant</em></strong>—of the trip. As you can see in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}, the speed varies and is sometimes less than the average speed, sometimes greater, and occasionally equal to the average speed over the trip. The general term for the kind of quantity presented by the speedometer is the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> of the position function with respect to the input to that function.</p>
<p>Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} shows the instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/instant-speed-1.png" width="672">
The two graphs in Figures @ref{fig:stop-and-go} and @ref{fig:instant-speed} show exactly the same car trip. The presentation of the data in the different graphs makes it easy to see some things and hard to see others. For instance, figuring out when the car is at a stand-still is harder in the position-vs-time graph than in the speed-vs-time graph. This is very much in the spirit of the sand-furrows example at the start of this chapter: it’s much easier to perceive the furrows because the lighting highlights areas sloping toward the sun as bright and areas sloping away from the sun as dark. In Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} we’re not using light-and-dark for the display. Instead, we’re showing the instantaneous speed as the vertical position</div>
<p>Recall that the interval between <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_C\)</span> had an <strong><em>average rate of change</em></strong> of about 39 miles-per-hour. Looking at the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> tells the story differently: at time <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span> the car was accelerating to about 60 miles-per-hour. Then it gradually slowed, coming to a stop just before time <span class="math inline">\(t_C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go} shows the function <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{position}(t)\)</span>. Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} shows a different function, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{speed}(t)\)</span>. Although the two functions are different, they are intimately related: <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{speed}(t)\)</span> is the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{position}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two central operations in calculus are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given a function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, find the function <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> giving the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>. This process of deriving <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is called <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Given a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span>, find the <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> of which <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> is the instantaneous rate of change. This process of finding <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> is called <strong><em>anti-differentiation</em></strong>.</li>
