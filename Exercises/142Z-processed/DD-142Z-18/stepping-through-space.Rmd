We're focusing now on the behavior of discrete-time dynamical systems near fixed points. Recall that we've defined $x$ and $y$ scales that have the fixed point at (0, 0) and that the dynamics can be approximated by linear functions which we write with a matrix. We'll call the matrix ${\mathbf A}$ and use ${\mathbf X}_n$ to denote the two-dimensional state at time $n$.  So the dynamics are: $${\mathbf X}_{n+1} = {\mathbf A}\, {\mathbf X}_n\ \ \ \text{where}\ \ {\mathbf A} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\c & d\end{array}\right]\  \text{for instance}\ \ \left[\begin{array}{rr}1.1 & -0.4\\0.3 & 0.9\end{array}\right]$$
This is all just a matter of arithmetic. Suppose we start at the initial condition ${\mathbf X}_0 = \left[\begin{array}{r}1.3\\0.5\end{array}\right]$. Using the example matrix from above, the value of ${\mathbf X}_{1}$ will be ${\mathbf A}\, {\mathbf X}_0$, or
$$
{\mathbf X}_1 = \underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{rr}1.1 & -0.4\\0.3 & 0.9\end{array}\right]}_{\mathbf A} \cdot \underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{r}1.3\\0.5\end{array}\right]}_{{\mathbf X}_0} = 1.3 \left[\begin{array}{r}1.1\\0.3\end{array}\right] + 0.5 \left[\begin{array}{r}-0.4\\0.9\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{r}1.23\\0.84\end{array}\right]
$$
Over the next few class sessions, you'll see why such systems are important in practice. For now, however, we want to see the behavior of such systems as they are iterated to higher $n$. We can obviously construct an infinite number of make-work exercises about matrix arithmetic. And we could have you push off the arithmetic labor onto the computer. But instead, we take heed of a famous epigram that's painted onto the wall in the Math Department offices (by the window overlooking the chapel):

> *The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.* --- Richard Hamming

If we were to have you calculate and display numerically sequences of vectors, it would be hard to extract insight into the patterns of matrix iteration. Instead, we'll use a graphical display, actually two:

1. The trajectory as it moves from step to step through state space, that is, the space $y$ versus $x$.
2. The "time series" for the variable $y$, that is, $y_n$ versus $n$. Think of this as a graph of $y$ versus time, while the state-space graph is $y$ versus $x$.

We'll let the computer do the arithmetic and graphing. Your job is to experiment with various matrices, explore the patterns of motion they produce, and gain some insight. Click on the picture of the app to bring it up in another tab of your browser, then arrange that tab and this one side by side.

**Slow and fast motion**

Each trajectory consists of a series of dots. The dots are connected with a thin line to help you see easily consecutive points, but these are discrete-time dynamics so only the dots are "real."

The spacing between consecutive dots is something like the "speed" of the motion, but perhaps "distance jumped" is a better metaphor to correspond to discrete time. For convenience, we'll say the motion is "slow" when consecutive dots are close together and "fast" when they are far apart.

One general pattern seen in linear dynamics near a fixed point is that the motion is slow near the fixed point and fast far from it. 

Sometimes the speed of motion is systematically faster for trajectories heading in some directions and slower for trajectories in other directions. But on any one trajectory, the motion will be faster far from the fixed point and slower near to it. Of course, the speed of motion is zero right at the fixed point: it's fixed!


**The saddle** Start with the matrix $${\mathbf A} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}0.90 & 0.05\\0.05 & 1.01\end{array}\right]$$
Set the number of iterations to, say, 100. Then click in the graph to start trajectories for many places near the perimeter of the graphic frame. You can just do this randomly at first, but then clear the graph and do it systematically to make the pattern of motion clear.

This pattern is called a "saddle," because the dynamics are analogous to the movement of a drop of water rolling down a horse saddle.

```{r sts-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "From initial conditions in a particular direction from the origin (that is, the fixed point), the trajectories head in straight to the origin. What direction is that? (Use the notation of the clock. So 6:00 is straight down, 9:00 is to the left, and so on.) Hint: Use the y versus n graph to determine where the trajectory started.",
  "+4:00 & 10:00+",
  "2:00 & 8:00",
  "6:00 & 12:00",
  "1:00 & 7:00",
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

```{r sts-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "The trajectories that head in almost straight to the fixed point, turn left or right and head away from the fixed point in another direction. What direction is that? Hint: Use the y versus n graph to determine where the trajectory started.",
  "4:00 & 10:00",
  "2:00 & 8:00",
  "6:00 & 12:00",
  "+1:00 & 7:00+",
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

The two directions you found in the previous two questions are called "characteristic directions," or, more generally, **characteristic vectors**. But in mathematics and the sciences, these are usually called **eigenvectors**. We denote the eigenvectors as ${\mathbf \Lambda}_1$ and ${\mathbf \Lambda}_2$, pronouced "lambda-one" and "lambda-two." Perhaps one way to remember that the ${\mathbf \Lambda}$s are each telling part of the story of the A matrix is to see that ${\mathbf \Lambda}$ is only part of A.

Associated with each eigenvector is a number called a **characteristic value** or **eigenvalue**. The two eigenvalues are displayed as $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ underneath the matrix. We'll defer for the present how these are calculated.

The dynamics have an extremely simple solution when they start on an eigenvector: motion right along that eigenvector. Suppose the initial condition is $m {\mathbf \Lambda}_1$
The solution is $${\mathbf X}_n = \lambda_1^n\ \  m {\mathbf \Lambda}_1$$ with the same for $\lambda_2$ and ${\mathbf \Lambda}_2$. 
Such motion is either stable ($|\lambda | < 1$) or unstable ($|\lambda| > 1$).

```{r sts-3, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which is the eigenvalue corresponding to the direction of stable motion?",
  "+0.88+",
   "0.9",
  "1.01",
  "1.03",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-4, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which is the eigenvalue corresponding to the direction of **unstable** motion?",
  "0.88",
   "0.9",
  "1.01",
  "+1.03+",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

The saddle behavior is "generic" in the sense that a small change to the numbers composing the matrix will still produce saddle motion.

**The source** In the app, change the matrix to $${\mathbf A} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}1.1 & 0.05\\0.05 & 1.1\end{array}\right]$$ and construct trajectories starting from all around the fixed point.

```{r sts-5, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which is the **stable** eigenvector?",
  "${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_1$",
  "${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_2$",
  "Both ${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_1$ and ${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_2$",
  "+There is no stable direction.+",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-6, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which is the **unstable** eigenvector?",
  "${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_1$",
  "${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_2$",
  "+Both ${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_1$ and ${\\mathbf \\Lambda}_2$+",
  "There is no stable direction.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-7, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Since motion along both eigenvectors is unstable, the trajectory moves away from the origin. Motion along one of the eigenvectors is relatively \"fast\" and motion along the other is \"slow\". (You can see the speed by looking at the spacing between dots on a trajectory) What is the eigenvalue for the **slow** direction?",
  "0.95",
  "+1.05+",
  "1.15",
  "1.25",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-8, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which direction does the \"slow\" eigenvector point in? (You may need to create many trajectories before you find one that is straight.)",
  "+4:30 - 10:30+",
  "1:30 - 7:30",
  "2:30 - 8:30",
  "There is no slow eigenvector.",
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

**The spiral node** In the app, change the matrix to $${\mathbf A} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}1.0 & -0.5\\0.5 & 0.9\end{array}\right]$$ and construct a single trajectory of 100 or so steps starting near the fixed point. (Why a single trajectory? You'll see.)

```{r sts-9, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What phrase best describes the trajectory?",
  "Clockwise spiral toward the fixed point",
  "Clockwise spiral away from the fixed point",
  "Counter-clockwise spiral toward the fixed point",
  "+Counter-clockwise spiral away from the fixed point+",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-10, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "What phrase best describes the time series $y_n$ versus $n$?",
  "exponential growth",
  "a sinusoid",
  "+a sinusoid whose amplitude grows exponentially+",
  "a sinusoid whose baseline is shifted away from zero",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r sts-11, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "The eigenvalues have a different form in the spiral motion than they did in the saddle or source. What's that difference?",
  "They are negative numbers.",
  "They are integers.",
  "They are real numbers.",
  "They are rational numbers (e.g. 15/32).",
  "They are irrational numbers (e.g, $\\pi$).",
  "+They are complex numbers.+" = "Numbers written like 0.3i are called \"imaginary\". Numbers with both a real and an imaginary part are called \"complex\" numbers." 
)  
```

**String art** This isn't an actual term in dynamics, but it is an apt description of the sorts of trajectories seen when one or both of the diagonal elements of the ${\mathbf A}$ matrix are negative. For instance, set the matrix in the app to $${\mathbf A} = \left[\begin{array}{rr}-1.00 & -0.02\\-0.01 & -1.00\end{array}\right]$$ and construct a trajectory with 100 or more steps. 

The trajectories are pretty complicated looking, but the time series of an individual component are not.

```{r sts-12, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Which of these phrases best describes the **time series** $y_n$ versus $n$?",
  "exponential growth",
  "exponential decay", 
  "+exponential growth but alternating signs+",
  "exponential decay but alternating signs",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)  
```

**Curved trajectories and curved time series** It's tempting---**but wrong**--- to look at the curves in trajectories as something like exponential growth. But keep in mind that the growth is exponential only in the time series. When a trajectory is sharply curved that corresponds to the motion starting in the direction of the slow eigenvector and then curving onto the fast eigenvector. Often this appears in the trajectory as an down-then-up kind of graph.
