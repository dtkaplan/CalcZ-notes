<h2>Do I know calculus?</h2>
<p>This section is not required and has no exercises. Nevertheless, you might find it useful in understanding the “big picture.”</p>
<p>Whenever you undertake to study a field, it’s helpful to be able to figure out when you have already learned enough and can apply what you know with confidence to solve the analysis and design tasks you encounter. In academia, we sidestep the heart of this important question and define “enough” in procedural terms: “enough” is when the semester has ended and you have passed the final exam. For academic institutions, especially ones based on the liberal arts, there’s little point in trying to be more definitive. After all, the “analysis and design tasks you [will] encounter” are as yet unknown, even though we can make reasonable guesses what many of them will be.</p>
<p>You will never know all there is to know about integration. Thousands of talented and highly trained mathematicians and applied scientists have contributed to the body of knowledge over 300+ years you simply don’t have enough time in your life to master all of it. Even if you devoted your life to this task, the field evolves. For instance, in 1953 (that may seem like antiquity) a hugely important integration innovation was presented <a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/Manual/EquationOfState.pdf">in this paper</a>. This method, which involves using random numbers, was refined, extended, and improved. A breakthrough in 1988 led to an algorithm for solving genuinely important applied problems in statistics that had previously been thought impossible.</p>
<p>Since you’ll never know everything about integration, you need to prioritize. But you are not yet in a position to set priorities. You’re at the start of a university-level sequence of courses and don’t yet know what you will encounter. Of course, your instructors know what’s in that sequence of courses and can make sensible choices for you, except … what’s in those courses depends on the traditions and conventions of those fields as interpreted by by the textbook writers in those fields. That’s rooted in the textbooks that those instructors used as students. In turn, those textbooks were shaped by the education of earlier textbook authors 50 and 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the prioritization we make for you has to do with the imperatives of our jobs as teachers. Instructors focus on topics that can be <em>assessed</em> successfully with the resources at hand. In practice this means topics where answers are either right or wrong and where its possible to generate new assessment questions easily. Sometimes, in some places, the cart gets put before the horse and ease of assessment becomes the highest priority.</p>
<p>CalcZ is motivated by a desire to start over from scratch and reframe priorities according to what skills you are likely to need in the next few years. Yet it would be a disservice to you to sweep the floor completely clean. An important part of your work in the next few years will be engaging with instructors who communicate using their own conceptions of calculus, largely formed when they were educated.</p>
<p>Which brings us to … today’s Daily Digital. We have already introduced you to methods of anti-differentiation based on algebraic notation, specifically anti-derivatives of basic modeling functions with a linear interior function. These are important and relatively easy to teach and learn.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to introduce you to two more algebraic methods of anti-differentiation: “u-substitution” and “integration by parts.” You may encounter these in some of your future courses. That “may” is likely enough that instructors of those courses rank them as high-priority topics for your introduction to calculus. They want us to teach these topics and the topics are without argument traditional components of introductory statistics courses.</p>
<p>Regrettably, an emphasis on three algebraic methods of integration will give you a picture that integration is about algebra. It is not. Integration is about functions. And there are many important and widely used function types for which there is no algebraic solution to the problem of integration. Yet <em>every function</em> can be anti-differentiated. And, a good technique for anti-differentiating any function is readily at hand via numerical techniques similar to the Euler method. These methods are implemented in a pretty simple R function: <code>antiD()</code>. Consider <code>antiD()</code> and learning to use it a fourth method of integration, and one that is much easier than either u-substitution or integration by parts. Since <code>antiD()</code> can handle all comers, while the algebraic methods can handle only a small (and hard to predict) set of functions, in terms of <em>using</em> anti-derivatives, <code>antiD()</code> would be the highest priority and would, on its own, be adequate for doing integration. The algebraic methods of integrating the basic modeling functions give you the vocabulary you need to communicate with the huge majority of people who learned calculus in the traditional, algebraic way. U-substitution and integration by parts bring you marginally further along, but not nearly so far along as computer algebra systems or even the traditional printed handbook called a “table of integrals.”</p>
<p>Finally, as you will learn in statistics, they way you take a sample is of fundamental importance in whether you will get a faithful representation of a process. In calculus textbooks (even our own MMAC text), the sample of integration problems is highly influenced by the relatively ease for instructors to generate new and never-before-seen functions that can be anti-differentiated using u-substitution or integration by parts. It’s safe to say that you would never encounter such functions in professional uses of calculus. (Uses other than teaching calculus, that is!)</p>
<p>If you have difficulty using u-substitution or integration by parts, you will be in the same league as the vast majority of calculus students. Think of your fellow students who master the topic in the way you think of ice dancers. It’s beautiful to watch, but hardly solves every problem. People who would fall on their face if strapped to a pair of skates have nonetheless made huge contributions in technical fields, even those that involve ice. (Prof. Kaplan once had a heart-to-heart with a 2009 Nobel-prize winner who confessed to always feeling bad and inadequate as a scientist because he had not done well in introductory calculus. It was only when he was nominated for the Nobel that he felt comfortable admitting to his “failure.”) Even if you don’t master u-substitution or integration by parts, remember that you can integrate any function using easily accessible resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-u-substitution" class="section level2">
<h2>u-substitution</h2>
<p>Differentiation and anti-differentiation are operations that undo one another. For instance, <span class="math display">\[F(t) = \int \left[\partial_t F(t)\right] dt + C\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[f(t) = \partial_t \int f(t) dt\]</span> We use differentiation and integration when we have information in one form (for instance a measurement of current in a circuit) and we find it more usefult to translate into another form (for instance the voltage across an element of the circuit).</p>
<p>There is little reason to use <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\int \left[\right]dt\)</span> to cancel each other out, but it is the basis of a successful strategy for finding some anti-derivatives algebraically. Here’s the differentiate/integrate algorithm behind u-substitution.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pick a function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> and another function <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>. Typically <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> belong to the family of basic modeling functions, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sin(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span>, and so on. For the purpose of illustration, we’ll use <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \ln(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(t) = \cos(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compose <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> to produce a new function <span class="math inline">\(f(g())\)</span> which, in our case, will be <span class="math inline">\(\ln(\cos(t))\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the chain rule to find <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t f(g(t))\)</span>. In the example, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1/x\)</span>, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-\sin(t)\)</span>. By the chain rule, <span class="math display">\[\partial_t f(g(t)) = - \frac{1}{g(t)} \sin(t)= -  \frac{\sin(t)}{\cos(t)} = - \tan(t)\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In a sense, we have just watched a function give birth to another through the straightforward process of differentiation. Having witnessed the birth, we know who is the integration mother of <span class="math inline">\(\tan(t)\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\int \tan(t) dt = \ln(\cos(t)\)</span>. For future reference, we might write this down in our diary of integrals: <span class="math display">\[\int \tan(t) dt = - \ln(\cos(t)) + C\]</span> Saving this fact in your diary is helpful. The next time you need to find <span class="math inline">\(\int \tan(x) dx\)</span>, you can look up the answer (<span class="math inline">\(-\ln(\cos(x)) + C\)</span>) from your diary. If you use <span class="math inline">\(\int \tan(x) dx\)</span> a lot, you will probably come to memorize the answer, just as you have already memorized that <span class="math inline">\(\int \cos(t) dt = \sin(t)\)</span> (a fact that you actually will use a lot in the rest of this course).</p>
<p>Now for the u-substitution game. The trick is to take a problem of the form <span class="math inline">\(\int h(t) dt\)</span> and extract from <span class="math inline">\(h(t)\)</span> two functions, an <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>. You’re going to do this so that <span class="math inline">\(h(t) = \partial_t F(g(t))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x F(x) = f(x)\)</span> Once you’ve done this, you have an answer to the original integration question: <span class="math inline">\(\int h(t) dt = F(g(t)) + C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here’s Example 7 from the MMAC book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evaluate the definite integral <span class="math inline">\(\int \frac{\sin(\ln(x))}{x} dx\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don’t know ahead of time that this is an integral amenable to solution by u-substitution. For all you know, it’s not. So you look at the instruction manual for calculating integrals that you don’t yet know:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is the integrand (that is <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\int h(x) dx\)</span>) one of the basic modeling functions (with, perhaps, a linear interior function)?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, you’ve already memorized the answer and you are done. If not …</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Assume for a moment—without any guarantee that this will work, mind you—that the answer can be built using u-substitution. You will therefore look hard at <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> and try to see in it a plausible form that looks like the derivative of some <span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the problem at hand, we can readily see something of the form <span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\ln(x))\)</span>. This immediately gives you a candidate for <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, namely, <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\equiv \ln(x)\)</span>. We don’t know <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> yet, but if <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> is the right guess, and if u-substitution is going to work, we know that <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> has to be something that produces <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> when you differentiate it. That’s <span class="math inline">\(-\cos()\)</span>. So now we have a guess <span class="math display">\[h_\mbox{guess}(x) = -\cos(\ln(x)) \partial_x \ln(x) = - \cos(\ln(x)) / x\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this guess matches the actual <span class="math inline">\(h()\)</span> then you win. The answer to <span class="math inline">\(\int h(x) dx\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(f(g(x)) = -\cos(\ln(x))\)</span>. If not, see if there is any other plausible guess for <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> to try. If you can’t find one that works, go on to</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Integration by parts. We’ll talk about this later.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If integration by parts doesn’t work … there is a variety of possibilities such as asking a math professor (who has a much larger set of functions at hand than you), looking through a table of integrals (which is to say, the collective calculus diary of generations of math professors), using a computer algebra system, or using numerical integration. One of these will work.</p>

<h2>Differentials</h2>
<p>The notation we have been using in this course for “the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\partial_x f\]</span> The subscript on the <span class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> indicates the”with respect to" variable, the curly-d <span class="math inline">\(\partial\)</span> itself signals “the derivative.” The identification of the “with respect to” variable is particularly important when the function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> has more than one input, for example with <span class="math inline">\(f(x, t) \equiv e^{-k x} \sin(\omega t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>With anti-differentiation (also called “integration”), we write things differently, for example <span class="math display">\[\int f(x, t) dx\]</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> signals the “with respect to” variable. And just as <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x, t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t f(x,t)\)</span> are different functions, so are <span class="math inline">\(\int f(x, t) dx\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\int f(x, t) dt\)</span>. Writing anti-differentiation/integration this way follows a convention of long standing.</p>
<p>In interpreting a sequence of symbols like <span class="math inline">\(\int f(x,t) dx\)</span>, it’s natural to think of the sequence as three parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{\int}_{\mbox{integral sign}} \overbrace{f(x, t)}^{\mbox{function to be anti-differentiated}} \underbrace{dx}_{\mbox{identifies &#39;with respect to&#39; variable}}\]</span></p>
<p>By analogy, the sentence</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mbox{We loaded up on snacks.}\]</span></p>
<p>consists of five parts: the five words in the sentence.</p>
<p>But you can also see “We loaded up on snacks” as having <em>three</em> parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{\mbox{We}}_{\mbox{subject}}\  
\overbrace{\mbox{loaded up on}}^{\mbox{verb}}\ \ \ 
\underbrace{\mbox{snacks}}_{\mbox{object}}\]</span></p>
<p>Likewise, the integrate sentence can be seen as consisting of just two parts:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{\int}_{\mbox{integral sign}} \overbrace{f(x, t) dx}^{\mbox{differential}}\]</span></p>
<p>A differential corresponds to the little rectangles that we add up when calculuting a definite integral numerically. That is <span class="math display">\[\underbrace{\int}_{\mbox{Sum}} \underbrace{\overbrace{f(x,t)}^\mbox{height} \overbrace{dx}^\mbox{width}}_\mbox{area of box}\]</span></p>
<p>A differential is a genuine mathematical object and is used, for example, in analyzing the geometry of curved spaces, as in the Theory of General Relativity. But this is well beyond the scope of this introductory calculus course.</p>
<p>There is one place in introductory calculus where you need to manipulate differentials: carrying out anti-differentiation of some functions that are not basic modeling functions with a linear interior function but which nonetheless have an anti-derivative that can be expressed in algebra.</p>
<p>You should be thinking in terms of differentials when you see a sentence like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In <span class="math inline">\(\int \sin(x) \cos(x) dx\)</span>, make the substitution <span class="math inline">\(u = \sin(x)\)</span>, implying that <span class="math inline">\(du = \cos(x) dx\)</span> and getting <span class="math inline">\(\int u du\)</span>, which is simple to integrate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table gives some examples of functions and their differentials. “w.r.t” means “with respect to.”</p>

<h2>Tables of integrals</h2>
<p>Although any function has an anti-derivative, that anti-derivative cannot always be presented in algebraic notation. This poses no fundamental problem to the construction of the anti-derivative, particularly when a computer is available to handle the book-keeping of numerical integration.</p>
<p>Still, it is convenient to have an algebraic form <em>when it can be found.</em> Many people have devoted considerable effort to constructing extensive collections of functions for which an algebraic form of anti-derivative is known. Think of such collections as a gallery of portraits of people who happen to have red hair. No matter how large the collection, you’ll often have to deal who are not redheads. And unlike real redheads, it can be hard to know whether a function has an anti-derivative that can be expressed simply in algebraic form. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \equiv \exp(-x^2)\)</span> does not, even though it is ubiquitous in fields such as statistics.</p>
<p>The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been a primary publisher for more than 50 years of information about functions encountered in applied mathematics. The work, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exf02R1FnXY">published originally in book form</a>, is also available via the internet as the <em><a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/">NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions</a></em>.</p>
<p>So, how to organize the gallery of redheads? Let’s take a field trip to the NIST DLMF (The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been a primary publisher for more than 50 years of information about functions encountered in applied mathematics. The work, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exf02R1FnXY">published originally in book form</a>, is also available via the internet as the <em><a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/">NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions</a></em>!</p>
<p>Warning! Many visitors to NIST DLMF encounter dizziness, fatigue, and anxiety. Should you experience such symptoms, close your eyes and remember that DLMF is a <em>reference work</em> and that you will not be examined on its use. Nonetheless, to help you benefit maximally from the field trip, there are a few questions in this Daily Digital for you to answer from DLMF.</p>
<p>You should also note that the techniques in almost universal use to help you navigate through voluminous collections of data (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) such as ratings, subscribing, “friending,” following, etc. are <em>entirely absent from DLMF</em>. There’s not even a friendly introduction to each chapter saying who the material might be of interest to.</p>
<p>We’re going to focus on Chapter 4, “Elementary Functions,” and indeed just a few sections from that chapter. (A better name for the chapter would be “The Functions Most Often Used.” They are not “elementary” as in “elementary school” but as in the “periodic table of elements.”)</p>
<p><a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/4.10">Section 4.10</a> covers integrals and anti-derivatives of logarithmic, exponential and power-law functions.</p>
<p><a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/4.26">Section 4.26</a> is similar, but for trigonometric functions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Navigate to <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/4.10.i">equation 4.10.1</a>. This is one of the anti-derivatives you are expected to know by heart in CalcZ.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Notice that the variable name <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is used. They could have selected any other name; <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> are popular, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> less so, and <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> even less so. The use of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is a signal to the <span title="plural noun:
people who are considered to be especially well informed about a particular subject: &#39;it was hailed by the cognoscenti as one of the best golf courses in Europe.;"><em>cognoscenti</em></span> that the function can be applied to both real and complex numbers.</li>
<li>Look at equation 4.10.8. This is another of the functions whose anti-derivative you should know by heart.</li>
<li>Perhaps it would have avoided some confusion if 4.10.1 had been written in terms of <span class="math display">\[\int \frac{1}{az}dz\]</span> so that you would know what to do if you had encountered such a function.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Some exercises:</p>
<pre>[Question DD-09-13]  Which of these is $$$︎\int \frac{1}{az}dz \ \mbox{?}$$$︎

(x)  $$$︎\frac{1}{a} \ln(z)$$$︎
( )  There is no anti-derivative of $$1/az$$.
( )  $$$︎a \ln(z)$$$︎

[[The level of the DLMF is such that you would be expected to know on your own that $\int \frac{1}{az} dz = \frac{1}{a}\int \frac{1}{z}dz$. In other words, the $\frac{1}{a}$ here is a scalar multiple of the function $\frac{1}{z}$ and "the integral of a scalar multiple of a function is the scalar multiple of the integral of the function.". Really.]]

</pre>
<pre>[Question DD-09-14]  Use Section 4.10 of DLMF to find $$$︎\int \frac{1}{3 t + 5}dt$$$︎

(x)  $$$︎\frac{1}{15}(3t - \ln(e^{3t} + 5))$$$︎
( )  There's no such function listed in Section 4.10.
( )  $$$︎\frac{1}{15}(5 t - \ln(e^{5t} + 3))$$$︎

[[]]

</pre>
<pre>[Question DD-09-15]  Is $$\frac{1}{e^{az} + b}$$ different from $$e^{-(az + b)}$$?

(x)  Yes
( )  No
( )  Depends on the value of $$b$$.

[[$e^{-(az + b)}$ is a simple exponential with the linear interior function $-(az + b)$.]]

</pre>
<pre>[Question DD-09-16]  Using section 4.26, find $$\int \tan(\theta) d\theta$$.

(x)  $$-\ln(\cos(\theta)$$
( )  $$\tan(\theta)$$ doesn't have an anti-derivative.
( )  There's no $$\theta$$ in section 4.26
