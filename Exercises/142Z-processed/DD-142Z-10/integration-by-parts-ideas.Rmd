In DD-08 we used the exponential probability density and talked about expectation values. Translate the following into a step-by-step process, asking questions along the way.

Find $\int \frac{1}{k} t e^{-t/k} dt$, the expectation value for the exponential probability distribution.

$$\int_a^b u \cdot dv = \left.u\cdot v \right|_a^b - \int_a^b v\cdot du$$

Let's look at the function $\frac{1}{k}\ t \ e^{-t/k}$

Suppose we let $dv = \frac{1}{k} e^{-t/k} dt$. This gives $v= -e^{-t/k}$.

Let $u = t$. Then $du = dt$.

Plugging in to the integration-by-parts formula we have

$$\int_{0}^\infty \frac{1}{k} t e^{-t/k} dt = \left[ t e^{-t/k}\right]_{0}^\infty + \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t/k}dt= 0  - \left[k e^{-t/k}\right]_0^\infty = k$$
