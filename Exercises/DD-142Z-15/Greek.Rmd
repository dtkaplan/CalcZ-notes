We will be using a handful of Greek letters in our mathematical notation. You should learn these by heart:

* $\alpha$  : alpha (lowercase)
* $\beta$  : beta (lowercase)
* $\lambda$  : lambda (lowercase)
* $\Lambda$  : lambda (uppercase)
* $\omega$  : omega (lowercase)
* $\xi$  : xi (lowercase), pronounced "ex-eee"
* $\eta$  : eta (lowercase)

The last two of these, $\xi$ and $\eta$ are the Greek equivalents to the familiar $x$ and $y$. We'll see $\xi$ and $\eta$ as arguments to functions that we will quickly be re-scaling and renaming $x$ and $y$.
