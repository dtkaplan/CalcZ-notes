title: "MMAC DD-01 Exercises"

In most *Daily Digitals*, there will  be exercises selected from the textbook. Some of these will be set up for you  to  submit answers in the same way you have for other *Daily Digital* problems. When this is the case, you do not need to retain any paper you have  used in forming your answer.

Sometimes, you will be explicitly instructed to hand-in your textbook exercise work on paper in the traditional way. You will be given instructions for how to submit this work via another mechanism.
