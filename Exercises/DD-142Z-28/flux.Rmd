Recall Newton's Law of Cooling, $\dot{T} = - k (T - T_a)$ Although temperature was hardly understood as a physical phenomenon in Newton's era, with today's sensibility you can understand that energy is flowing into or out of the object from the ambient environment. The word *flux* is often used in mathematics to refer to such flows.

We've studied cooling in a spatially discrete context, the cooling of a single point (e.g. "a cup of coffee") in an environment that has only one property, the "ambient" temperature. 

Let's switch to a spatially *continuous* context, a bar of iron with one end lying in a bed of hot coals and the other end in the open air, as in the picture:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/hot-iron.png")
```

The iron rod is incandescent at the right end and cooler toward the left. If the picture were a movie, you likely would be able to predict what the action will be:  Heat will flow down the rod from right to left. The free end of the rod will eventually get burning hot. 

The temperature $T$ at each point $x$ in the rod is a function of position. But at any given position, the temperature is a function of time $t$. That is, the temperature of the rod is a function of two variables: $T(x,t)$.

If we were thinking about the movie frame-by-frame, we might prefer to treat $t$ as a discrete variable and could write $T(x,t)$ as $T_t(x)$. It doesn't really matter which, but it helps to think about $T()$ as a function of $x$ whose shape evolving in time.

Now back to Newton's Law of Cooling. The flux of heat is the difference between the object's temperature and the ambient temperature. But in the continuous spatial system, the *difference* in temperature between two infinitely close neighboring points is zero. That suggests no flux. Of course, a major theme in Calculus is to provide means to discuss the *rate of difference* of a value at two infinitely close points: the derivative $\partial_x T(x, t)$. This derivative gives the flux of heat from right to left. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
n <- 100
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
  x = seq(0, 50, length=n),
  x2 = x+50/n,
  y = 200,
  hot = viridis::magma(n, dir=1)
)
gf_segment(100 + 1250 ~ 0 + 50) %>%
  gf_text(250 ~ c(35, 40, 45), label=c("C", "B", "A")) %>%
  gf_labs(x="Position in rod x (cm)",
         y="Temperature of rod (deg C)",
         title="T(x, t=100s)") %>%
  gf_segment(y +y ~ x + x2, color = ~ hot, data = Pts, size=5, inherit=FALSE) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_identity())
```



It might be tempting to translate this directly into the terms of Newton's Law of Cooling and claim, **wrongly** that $\partial_t T(x, t) = -k \partial_x T(x, t)$. Why is this wrong? In the spatially discrete setting---cup of coffee, ambient environment---there are only two spatial points of interest. But along the continuous iron rod, there are at least **three** points to be considered. Let's call them $x_A$, $x_B$, and $x_C$ as in the diagram. We're interested in $\partial_t T(x_B, t)$. This change in temperature at point B is driven by the flux from point C to point B and is proportional to $\partial_x T(x_B, t)$. But the change in temperature at point B is equally influenced by the flux from B to A. That is, the change in temperature at point B is set by the *difference in flux*, the flux coming from A to B and the flux going from B to C. 

In the spatially continuous context, the *net flux* or *difference in differences* (A to B, B to C) is represented by the **second derivative** with respect to $x$. That is, along the rod, Newton's Law of Cooling amounts to $$\partial_t T(x, t) = k\, \partial_{xx} T(x, t)$$ This is called the **heat equation** and was introduced in 1807 by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1786-1830). The same equation is now also called the **diffusion equation**.

Some people might be more comfortable thinking about the discrete-time dynamics of the movie, which could be written
$$T_{t+h}(x) \approx T_t(x) + h\,k\, \partial_{xx} T_t(x)$$

Exercise: Turn away from the iron rod of the picture and imagine being presented with four new rods each of which has been heated in some way to produce a temperature profile at time 0, that is $T_0(x)$ as shown in the four graphs below.

slice_plot(70 + 100* (2-cos(x)) ~ x, domain(x=c(-1,1))) %>%
  gf_labs(x="Position x", y = "Temperature", title = "(B)") %>%
