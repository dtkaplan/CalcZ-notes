title: "MMAC ยง1.5 Exercises 45-50 "
---

This question  refers to the graphs labelled 45 to 50 on p. 88 of the MMAC textbook.

For each of the graphs, make a rough but reasonable copy of the graph on  your homework paper. Use the horizontal line test to  determine if the function has an inverse.

If so, sketch the inverse (roughly, but reasonably) next to the original graph.

If not, circle or otherwise indicate the features of the function that cause it not to have a inverse.

(Note: In these graphs and many throughout the MMAC textbook, the scales of the graph are not labeled. This is a poor practice. Scales should always be labeled to  indicate what quantity they represent. There's nothing you can do about it here, since the book doesn't provide the necessary information. But be aware of this bad practice when you encounter it and try to avoid it in your professional work.)
