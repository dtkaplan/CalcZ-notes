We've already seen several calculus-related strategies that address important modeling scenarios, for example translating a setting into a "target problem" in linear algebra, modeling using low-order polynomials, using power transformations (e.g. $\sqrt()$ or $\ln()$) to refine models, and so on.

In this Daily Digital, we're going to elaborate on a strategy called "differential modeling" that has already appeared implicitly in many problems.

You've already seen differential modeling at work in calculating areas and other sorts of accumulation. The setting should be familiar at this point. We have a function $f(x)$ and we wish to accumulate it over some interval in $x$, say $a \leq x \leq b$. Such accumulation problems are very simply stated: $$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$ This is really just a matter of notation; the use of the integral sign doesn't convey any more information than the phrase "accumulate $f(x)$."

You've also learned some techniques for doing the calculation called for by $\int_a^b f(x) dx$. One such technique is anti-differentiation to construct a new function $F(x)$ such that $\partial_x F(x) = f(x)$. Then, following the "fundamental theorem of calculus," we can solve the integral by evaluating $F(b) - F(a)$. Another technique is Euler integration (And there are numerical techniques that improve on Euler, either by reducing the number of numerical calculations or improving the precision of the result). Still another techique is to draw on the collective memory of mathematicians of the last 350 years and look up $f(x)$ in a "table of integrals" to find an anti-derivative that you might not have been to construct on your own.
