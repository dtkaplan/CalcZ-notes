Compare the functions $f_1 <- \dnorm(x, mn, sd)$ and $f_2 <- \dnorm\left(\left[x-mn\right]/sd\right)$ by plotting them out in a `r sandbox_link()`.

In order to construct the plot, you'll have to pick specific values for $mn$ and $sd$. Make sure that you use the same $sd$ and $mn$ when constructing $f_1()$ and $f_2()$.

```{r dnorm8-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "When $sd = 1$, are the two functions the same?",
  "+Yes+",
  "Yes, but only if $mn=1$",
  "Yes, but only if $mn=0$",
  "No", 
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r dnorm8-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "When $sd \neq 1$, for any given $mn$, the two functions are not the same. What's the relationship between $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)?",
  "+$f_2(x) = sd\\, f_1(x)$+",
  "$f_1(x) = sd\\, f_2(x)$",
  "$f_1(x) = sd^2 f_2(x)$",
  "$f_2(x) = sd^2 f_1(x)$",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
