The contour plot of function $g(y, z)$ is overlaid with vectors. The black vector is a correct representation of the gradient (at the root of the vector). The other vectors are also supposed to represent the gradient, but might have something wrong with them (or might not). You're job is to say what's wrong with each of those vectors.
