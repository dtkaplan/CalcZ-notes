```{r zoz1-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Just plot the function", exercise.nlines=5, eval=FALSE}
g <- makeFun(x * log(x) ~ x)
slice_plot(g(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(0, 0.5)))
```

Many indeterminate forms are made readily accessible due to two features of R: divide by zero returns `Inf` but zero divided by zero returns `NaN`. Plotting software simply discards the `NaN` as unplottable leaving a perfectly coherent graph.

You may have to zoom in on the domain to get a clear read of the
function value at $x=0$ singularity.

```{r zoz1-8, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "From the graph, determine $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} x \\ln(x()$. Choose the correct answer.",
  -0.2, "+0+", 0.1, 0.5,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
