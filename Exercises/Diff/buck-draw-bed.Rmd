In function compositions of the form $f\left(\strut g(x)\right)$, the function $f()$ is called the ***exterior function*** and $g()$ is called the ***interior function.***

```{r bdb932-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  r"(In $\cos(\ln(x))$ which is the **interior** function?)",
  r"(+$\ln()$+)",
  r"($\cos()$)" = "This is the exterior function.", 
  r"($\sin()$)" = "Sine has nothing to do with it!",
  "None of the above", 
  "It's not a function composition",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r bdb932-2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  r"(In $1/\sin(x)$ which is the **exterior** function?)",
  r"(+$\recip()$+)",
  r"($\cos()$)", 
  r"($\sin()$)" = "This is the interior function.", 
  "None of the above", 
  "It's not a function composition",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```


**Add more of these.**
