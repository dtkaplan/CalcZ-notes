Suppose we describe the spread of an infection in terms of three variables:

- $N$ infection rate with respect to time: the number of new infections per day
- $I$ the current number of people who are infectious, that is, currently capable of spreading the infection
- $S$ the number of people who are susceptible, that is, currently capable of becoming infectious if exposed to the infection.

All three of these variables are functions of time. News reports in 2020 routinely such as the one below gave the graph of $N$ versus time for Covid-19. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("www/covid-nov-15-2020.png"))
```


On November 15, 2020, $N$ was 135,187 people per day. (This is the number positive tests. The true value of $N$ is 5-10 times greater.) The news reports don't usually report $S$ on a day-by-day basis. 

But a basic strategy in modeling with calculus is to take a snapshot: Given $I$ and $S$ *today*, what is a model of $N$ for today. (Next semester, we'll study "differential equations," which provide a way of assembling from the snapshot model what the time course of the pandemic will look like.)

<!-- On Nov. 15, $S$ is roughly 250,000,000, compared to 330,000,000 at the start of the pandemic. Given that true $N$ is about 1,000,000 per day, $S$ changes by about 1% per day, so at the end of the year, we can anticipate $S$ will be about 200,000,000 people. According to expert opinion, new infectives are infectious for about 4-6 days (on average), so we can anticipate that $I \approx 5 N$. -->

The low-order polynomial for $N(S, I)$ is $$N(S,I) = a_0 + a_1 S + a_2 I + a_{12} I S.$$ We don't include quadratic terms because there is no local maximum in $N(S, I)$---common sense suggests that $\partial_S N() \geq 0$ and $\partial_I N() \geq 0$, whereas a local maximum requires at least one of these derivatives to be negative near the max.

Your job is to figure out which, if any, terms can be safely deleted from the low-order polynomial. A good way to approach this is to figure out, using common sense, what $N$ would be for either $S=0$ or $I=0$. (Note that the previous is not restricted to $S = I = 0$. Only one of them needs to be zero to produce the relevant result.)

```{r daily-digital-33-QA6, echo=FALSE}
etude2::etudeQ(
  prompt = "Which of these is a sufficiently complete low-order polynomial given the behavior of $N$ at $S=0$ or $I=0$?",
    "$N(S,I) = a_0 + a_1 S + a_2 I + a_{12} I S$" = "We don't need all four terms. Think about it!",
    "$N(S,I) = a_0 + a_1 S + a_2 I$" = "When both $S$ and $I$ are zero, $N$ would be non-zero.",
    "$N(S,I) = a_1 S + a_2 I + a_{12} I S$" = "",
    "$N(S,I) = a_2 I + a_{12} I S$" = "",
    "$N(S,I) = a_1 S + a_{12} I S$" = "",
    "+$N(S,I) = a_{12} I S$+" = "",
    "$N(S,I) = a_1 S + a_2 I$" = "", 
  inline = FALSE,
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
