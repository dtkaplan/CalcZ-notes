Here is a graph of $\sin(x)$ with points marked at $x=-\pi/2$, $x=0.5$, and $x = \pi/2$. At each of those points, an inscribed circle has been drawn, tangent to the function at that point. 

```{r}
f <- makeFun(sin(x) ~ x)
slice_plot(f(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-3,3))) %>%
  gf_path(y ~ x, data = inscribed_circle(f(x) ~ x, -pi/2), color="tan", size=2, alpha=0.4) %>%
  gf_path(y ~ x, data = inscribed_circle(f(x) ~ x, .5), color="blue", size=2, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_path(y ~ x, data = inscribed_circle(f(x) ~ x, +pi/2), color="green", size=2, alpha=0.5) %>%
  gf_point(1 ~ pi/2) %>%
  gf_point( sin(0.5) ~ 0.5) %>%
  gf_point(-1 ~ -pi/2) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed(xlim=c(-3,3), ylim=c(-2, 2)))
```

You're task is to calculate the curvature $\cal K$ at each of those three input points. This is a matter of calculating the first and second derivatives of the sine function, evaluating those derivatives at the input values, and plugging them in to the formula in Section \@ref(curvature-definition).
