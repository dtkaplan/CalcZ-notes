We're writing the 1-D differential equation as $\dot{x} = f(x)$. Remember that every possible 1-D differential equation can be written this way. The thing that distinguishes one equation from another is the dynamics function $f()$. 

We have examined a few possibilities for $f()$, for instance:

i. $f(x) = a x$ -- the linear function: $f(x)$ is **proportional** to $x$.
ii. $f(x) = a x + b$ -- the straight-line function
iii. $f(x) = r x (1-x/K)$ -- the so-called "logistic" function

There are other forms of $f()$ that a modeler occasionally encounters, such as

iv. $f(x) = a x^2$, or
v. $f(x) = a \sqrt{\strut x}$
vi. ... and many others!

But (i), (ii), and (iii) are by far the most common, so we focus on them.

Each of (i), (ii), and (iii) has a solution in terms of the basic modeling functions we have used throughout CalcZ: sinusoid, sigmoidal, exponential, and so on. These solutions have been known for at least 200 years. This means that an operational ability to solve a differential equation is a matter of memorizing those solutions.

Our goal in this section is to help you understand in general the logic of finding solutions to differential equations. To find a solution means finding a **function** <span style='color: blue; font-size: 30px;'>$x(t)$</span> that satifies

<span style='font-size: 36px;'><span style='color: red'>$\dot{x(t)}$</span> $=$ <span style='color: green'>$f(x(t))$</span>

There are multiple strategies for finding that function $x$. An important one of which is to make a <span style='color: blue;'>guess about the function form</span> (e.g. sinusoid, exponential, etc.) then varying the parameters of that function until the <span style='color: red;'>function on the left side</span> matches the <span style='color: green;'>function on the right side</span>. 

<div class="reminder-note">

**Reminder**:

Following convention, we simplify the notation by leaving out any explicit mention of $t$. 

<span style='font-size: 36px;'><span style='color: red'>$\dot{x}$</span> $=$ <span style='color: green'>$f(x)$</span>

The role of $t$ in the differentiation is made implicit by the **dot** on the $x$. It's so, so easy to forget this and become confused. So be careful to be attentive to the dot in $\dot{x}$ as signalling the derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$.

</div>

An *ansatz* is a guess for a form of $x(t)$ that might balance the <span style='color: red;'>left</span> and <span style='color: green;'>right</span> sides of the differential equation.

To help you form an intuition for the ansatz style of solving differential equations, we provide you with an interactive app:

<a href="https://maa-statprep.shinyapps.io/142Z-balance-derivs/" target="_blank"><img src='www/balance-derivs.png' width="50%"></a>

As usual, click on the picture of the app to open it in another browser tab, then arrange this tab and that to be side by side on your screen.

In this app, all you are going to do is search for a solution to the simple, 1-D differential equation:

<span style='font-size: 30px;'>$$\dot{x} = a x$$</span>

In the exercises that follow, we are going to specify a numerical value for $a$ (You'll have to set $a$ to the specified value using the little selector underneath the equation in the left-hand panel of the app).

You may have already memorized the solution to this differential equation. But for now, let's pretend that you have not and that you are going to find a solution by the ansatz method.

The equipment you have to aid in your search is:

1. A selector for the **form** of ansatz (e.g. sinusoidal, exponential, etc.). Note that each form has one or two **parameters**.
2. A slider control for each of the parameters in (1).

The action plays out this way:

a. Pick one of the ansatze on offer. The exercises will tell you which one to use. **There is no guarantee that the one we tell you to use will provide a successful solution.** That might seem mean, but we want you to be able to tell when a proposed solution doesn't work out.
b. Gradually move the parameter slider(s). This will change the shape of the candidate function shown in blue in the top graph.
c. Observe the two functions shown in the bottom graph.
    i. The red function is simply the time derivative of the blue function in the top graph. That is, the red function is what goes on the left-hand side of the differential equation.
    ii. The green function is $a x$, that is, the right side of the differential equation.
d. To satisfy the differential equation, the left and the right sides must be the same function. You can easily see if this is the case when the red and green functions lie exactly on top of one another. 

It might be that no matter how you set the parameters, you cannot get the red and green functions to align. This signals that the ansatz being used is not appropriate for this differential equation.
