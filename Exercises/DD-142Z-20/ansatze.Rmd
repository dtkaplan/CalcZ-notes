In mathematics, a proposed but not yet proved answer to a question is called an *ansatz*. (Plural is *ans√§tze*.) Starting with an ansatz is very powerful, since you can use substitution to check. 

```{r an1, echo=FALSE}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "Consider the differential equation $\\dot{y} = 3 y$. Is the ansatz $y = 10 \\times 3^t$ correct?",
  "Yes",
  "+No+" = "A correct ansatz would be $y_0 e^{3t}$",
  "Not enough information",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

```{r an2, echo=FALSE}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "Consider the differential equation $t \\dot{y} - 2y = 0$. Is the ansatz $y=t^2$ correct?",
  "+Yes+",
  "No",
  "Not enough information",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
