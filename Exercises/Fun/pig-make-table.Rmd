DRAFT I'm moving this to drill style

In Section \@ref(scaling-the-input) there is a table giving several f

Similar to MWLCS but with input scaling of the form $ax$.

Each of the following graphs shows a pattern-book function with input scaling and zero horizontal shift. For instance, the pattern-book sinusoid $\sin(x)$ is plotted here as $\sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P} x)\right)$ and the pattern-book gaussian $\dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)$ is plotted here as $\dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=a)$.

Your task is to find the parameter $P$, $a$
