When your R command is not a complete sentence, the `r sandbox_link()` will display an error like this:

<span style="font-color: red;"><code>Error in parse(text = x, keep.source = TRUE) : <text>:5:0: unexpected end of input </code></span>

The "unexpected end of input" is the computer's way of saying, "You haven't finished your sentence so I don't know what to do."

Each of these R expressions is incomplete. Your job, which you should do in a sandbox, is to turn each into a complete expression. Sometimes you'll have to be creative, since when a sentence is incomplete you, like the computer, don't really know what it means to say! But each of these erroneous expressions can be fixed by **adding** or **changing** text.

i.  `sin 3`
ii. `sin(3`
iii. `sin 3)`
iv. `((16 - 4) + (14 + 2) / sqrt(7)`
v. `pnorm(3; mean=2, sd=4)`
vi. `log[7]`
vii. `14(3 + 7)`
viii. `e^2`
ix. `3 + 4 x + 2 x^2`
