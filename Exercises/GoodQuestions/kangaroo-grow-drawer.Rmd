Consider a function $T(\text{longitude}, t)$ that gives the air temperature along Earth's equator as a function of longitude and time. Presumably, that temperature varies with longitude as the equator crosses sea, coast, mountain, and desert. 

```{r kgdw-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Is there necessarily a pair of equatorial points separated by 180 degrees in longitude---that is, diametrically opposed on the Earth's surface---that have exactly the same temperature at the same time $t$?",
  "+Yes+" = "", 
  "No" = "Pick a point along the equator. The temperature at that point and at a diametrically opposed point are likely not equal. Let's say the difference is positive. Now move both points along the equator, keeping them diametrically opposite. When you have gone 180 degrees, you will be back at the original points, but the sign of the difference in temperature will be different than it was initially. So the difference in temperatures went from positive to negative. Assuming temperature is a continuous function of longitude, the difference in temperatures must have crossed zero at one or more points.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
