A drippy faucet adds one millimeter to the volume of water in a tub at times that are roughly evenly spaced $\cdots < t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots $. We'll call the volume of water as a function of time $V(t)$. Draw a graphics with the horizontal $t$-axis marked with $t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots$ which can be times of your choosing. 

1. Draw a graph of $V(t)$ under the assumption that the water droplets cause an **instantaneous** increase in volume.

2. Suppose the volume $V(t)$ is being measured by a sensitive water-level detector mounted in the tub somewhere away from where the drops fall. Think about the effect of a real-world drop on the surface of the water and draw in another color on top of your graph from (1) what the function might look like.

3. For each of of the functions graphed in (1) and (2), say whether you consider the function to be continuous or discontinuous.
