Suppose $w(t)$ is your weight and $h(t)$ is your height and that the domain of both functions encompasses your whole life span. It's reasonable to consider each of these functions to be continuous. So the function $h(t) - w(t)$ is continuous.

```{r ewdy-1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
askMC(
  "Is the following statement true? At some time since you were born your weight in pounds equaled your height in inches.", 
  "+True+"= "",
  "False" = "The value of this function when you were born was greater than zero. Calculate the value for $t=$today and you'll see that it is negative. A continuous function whose value goes from positive to negative must cross 0 at least once.",
  random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```
