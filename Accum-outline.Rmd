This outline was that established during the May 17-19, 2021 working sessions at USAFi. It's copied directly from the Teams document. I've made some modifications which are noted in [[square brackets]] for deletions and **bold face** for additions..

1. Iteration and Euler’s Method
    a. NTI
        i. We’re only going to go by-hand up to 3 iterations of Euler’s method
        i. We’ll show the students a loop, but not make them create the loop
    b. Topics
        i. Tie in loops as (iteration)
        i. Reversing the difference quotient (the slope function $\diff{x}f(x)$)
        i. Initial values
        i. By hand
        i. Implement on a computer

2. Accumulation as net change
    a. NTI:
        i. Introduce definition of definite integral as the mathematical notation for accumulation (Euler’s method)
    b. Topics
        i. Notation for definite integrals (connected to Euler's method)
        ii. Accumulation via antidifferentiation
        iii. Concrete examples of anti-differentiation
            i. Acceleration-velocity-displacement
            i. Area

3. Basic antiderivative rules
    a. Topics
        i. Exponential functions
        i. Sine and Cosine

        i. Simple combinations of all of the above

4. Properties of Accumulation
    a. Topics 
        i. Linear properties
            1. Sum and difference
            1. Multiplication by a constant
        i. Reversing limits of integration
        i. Additive property for an inserted limit of integration
        i. Definite integrals of constant and linear functions geometrically
        i. Units and dimension of definite integral


5. Antiderivatives by method of substitution
    i. Reversing the chain rule

6. Antiderivatives by method of integration by parts
    i. Reversing the product rule

7. Review of all antiderivative methods



Orphaned
i. Average value (?)
