# (PART) Block 2: Differences and differentiation {.unnumbered}

# Functions and patterns

As you know, a function takes one or more inputs and returns a value as output. The functions we examine in CalcZ take *quantities* as inputs and return a *quantity* as an output. 
The algorithm that forms the body of the function describes arithmetic and other calculations that can turn the inputs into the output. 

On the other hand, we can also use ***tables*** as functions. With a table, you specify the input, look up that input in one of the colums of the table which brings you to the right row. Then read out from that row the value in another column to be the output. The quantitative operation needed for table lookup is simple comparison. The floor/corridor/door metaphor describes table lookup as well as function evaluation. 

In the previous block, we constructed functions to represent the patterns seen in data. In one example, we constructed a function $g(t) = A + B e^{-k t}$ to represent the temperature of water cooling in a mug as a function of time. In another example, we summarized the pattern of rising and falling tides. 

It's common sense that data is stored in tables. But we could easily represent any smooth mathematical function, such as our basic modeling functions, as a table look-up problem. Indeed, in the era before computers, many mathematical functions were used in exactly this manner: a printed table in which a person could search for a match to the input and retrieve a value for the output.

[Picture of some nice old table.]

In the computer era, we still routinely represent functions this way: data stored in computer files. For instance, an MP3 file is not much more than a sequence of numbers that record a complicated function of time: the air pressure variations of sound. Similarly, digital images record functions of $x$ and $y$ over a limited domain. Given $x$ and $y$ as input, you can look up the output by going to the right pixel.

We humans of course, don't perceive the numerical output of either sound or image functions: we **hear** a sound and we **see** an image. We've got special biological equipment for this!

Consider the image in Figure \@ref{fig:sand-1}. It is a picture of some indentations in a small area of sand, about two inches wide in the middle of a hiking trail. The dots are individual grains of sand.

```{r sand-1, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/sand-furrows.png")
```

Can you see three almost parallel furrows? How about the small crater in the upper left?

You can see the individual grains of sand because they contrast sharply with their neighbors. Or, more precisely, you can see a few dozen grains **because** they contrast sharply with their neighbors.


You can think of the surface of the sand as a function of $x$ and $y$. It's lower in some places and higher in others. But, in fact, you can't see the height of an individual point in the photograph. In the right light, you wouldn't notice the furrows at all. But the way the picture is lighted, raking sunlight from the left, the surface is translated into broad regions of brightness and shadow. In the light regions, the surface slants toward the sun. In the shadows, the surface slants away from the sun. 

What you're mainly seeing in the photo is the ***slant*** or ***slope*** of the surface. The light has transformed *elevation* as a function of $x$ and $y$ into *slant* as a function of $x$ and $y$ and then encoded the slant as brightness, in much the same way the background of a contour plot encodes the output of the function as a color. 

The moral here is that sometimes the data in a function is not in the right form for us to extract useful information. But by transforming that data to represent contrast or difference or slope, the information can be revealed.

This Block is about transforming functions to show difference and slope. Such transformation, accomplished by mathematics rather than the raking light of the sun, can take a pattern that we're presented with and turn it into another pattern that can tell us what we want to know. 

## Average rate of change

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
state_objective("Deriv-2a", "Identify the \"average rate of change\" of a function over an interval as the overall change in output divided by the change in input.")
```
:::

As you know, one way to calculate the slope of a straight-line function $f()$ is to pick two different values for the input: call the larger of them $x_1$ and the smaller $x_0$. Think of these input values as the endpoints of an ***interval*** or ***neighborhood*** of the domain. The length of this domain is $x_1 - x_0$. 

Evaluate the function at those endpoints and calculate the slope simply as the difference in output divided by the length of the interval: $$\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}$$

"Slope" is a natural metaphor when thinking of a function as a graph. But a more general way to describe the concept is the ***rate of change*** of the output with respect to the input. The change in the output from one end of the interval  is $f(x_1) - f(x_0)$, the change in the input is $x_1 - x_0$. If the input is time (in hours), and the output is the position of a car (in miles), then the rate of change is *miles-per-hour*: the car's velocity.

For a straight-line function---think of a car driving at constant speed on a highway---it doesn't matter what you choose for $x_1$ and $x_0$ (so long as they are not identical). But for other functions, the choice does matter.

Imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in Figure \@ref{fig:stop-and-go}. Over the course of an hour, the car travelled about 25 miles. In other words, the ***average*** speed is 25 miles/hour: the *slope* of the red line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car was stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D) and sometimes much faster than average (time B).  

```{r stop-and-go, echo=FALSE}
f <- rfun(~ t, seed=105, n=5)
raw <- function(t) 
        f(t) - t - 30*dnorm(t, 0, 3) + 60*dnorm(t,7,1)
speed <- function(t) {
    pmax(4*raw(20*(t-.5)), 0)
}
position <- antiD(speed(t) ~ t)
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
    t = c(0, 0.19, 0.4, 0.54, 0.65, 1),
    y = position(t) + 2,
    label=c("", "A", "B", "C", "D", "")
)
Intervals <- tibble::tribble(
    ~t0, ~ t1, ~color,
    0, 1, "red",
    .54, .65, "orange",
    .19, .4, "green",
    .4, .54, "brown",
) %>%
    mutate(y0=position(t0), y1=position(t1))
slice_plot(position(t) ~ t, domain(t = c(0, 1)), size=2) %>%
    gf_labs(y = "x(t): Position from start of trip (miles)",
            x = "Time since start (hours)") %>%
    gf_text(0 ~ t, data = Pts, label=~label, color="blue") %>%
    gf_segment(2 + y ~ t + t, data = Pts[-6,], color="blue") %>%
    gf_segment(y0 + y1 ~ t0 + t1, data = Intervals, color=~color, alpha=0.5, size=3) %>%
    gf_refine(scale_color_identity())
```

During the interval from B to C, the car was travelling relatively fast. The slope of the brown segment connecting the position at times B and C is the ***average*** rate of change between times B and C. It's easy to see that the average rate of change from B to C is larger than the overall average from $t=0$ to $t=1$. Calculating that slope is a matter of evaluating the position at the endpoints and dividing by the length of the interval.

What is the average rate of change in the car's position during the interval $t_B = 0.40$ to $t_C=0.54$?

The length of the interval is $t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14$.

Evaluating the function gives $x(t_C) = 18$ and $x(t_B) = 12.6$. 

Rise is $x(t_C) - x(t_B) = 18 - 12.6 = 5.4$.

Run is $t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14$.

The average rate of change during the interval is $5.4/0.14 = 38.6 $ miles/hour.

The graph shows a simplified model of the amount of usable wood that can be harvested from a typical tree in a managed forest of Ponderosa Pine. (You can see some actual forestry research models [here](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr292/1992_milner.pdf).)

```{r aver-tree, echo=FALSE}
tree_volume <- makeFun(1000*pnorm(year, mean=15, sd=10)^3 ~ year)
slice_plot(tree_volume(year) ~ year, domain(year = c(0, 50))) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Usable wood product (board-feet)",
          x = "Year after planting")

```

You are writing a business plan for a proposed pine forest. Among other things, you have to forecast the revenue that will be generated and when you will have salable product.

They say that "time is money." Every year you wait before harvest is another year that you don't have the money. On the other hand, every year that you wait means more wood at the end. How to decide when to harvest? 

The tree continues to grow until year 50, when it seems to have reached an equilibrium: perhaps growth goes to zero, or rot balances what growth there is. There's no point waiting until after year 50. 

At year 25, the tree is growing as fast as it ever will. You'll get about 600 board-feet of lumber. Should you harvest at year 25? No! That the tree is growing so fast means that you will have a lot more wood at year 26, 27, and so on. The time to harvest is when the growth is getting smaller, so that it's not worth waiting an extra year.

The quantity of interest is the average rate of growth from seedling to harvest. Harvesting at year 25 will give a total change of 600 board feet over 25 years, giving an average rate of change of $600 \div 25 = 24 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}$. But if you wait until year 35, you'll have about 900 board feet, giving an average rate of change of $900 \div 35 = 25.7 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}. 
:::

We've been presenting the average rate of change as a **number**: $$\frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}$$

But it's helpful to think of it as a **function** that takes two inputs, which we can call $t_A$ and $t_B$:
$$\mbox{ave_rate_of_change}(t_A, t_B) \equiv \frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}$$
This is a very subtle manoeuvre. The formula is exactly the same, but by writing the quantities $t_A$ and $t_B$ as inputs (by putting them in parentheses on the left side), we turn the formula into a function.

Sometimes the average-rate-of-change function presents the information in a clear way.

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Back to the forest ... Here's a graph of the average-rate-of change function. The function has two inputs, but botany dictates that we can only be growing word from the time the seedling is planted. So we'll set $t_A = 0$ and look at the corresponding *slice* of the function:

```{r echo=FALSE}
slice_plot(tree_volume(year)/year ~ year, domain(year = c(1, 50))) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Annual growth (board-feet)",
          x = "Year after planting")
```
The graph makes it clear that the maximum average growth from planting to harvest will occur at about year 32.

## Instantaneous rate of change

::: {.objectives latex-data=""}
```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
state_objective("Deriv-2b", "Distinguish the \"average rate of change\" from the \"instantaneous rate of change\".")
```

The car's speedometer shows the speed at each moment---or ***instant***---of the trip. As you can see in Figure \@ref{fig:stop-and-go}, the speed varies and is sometimes less than the average speed, sometimes greater, and occasionally equal to the average speed over the trip. The general term for the kind of quantity presented by the speedometer is the ***instantaneous rate of change*** of the position function with respect to the input to that function. 

Figure \@ref{fig:instant-speed} shows the instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time.

```{r instant-speed, echo=FALSE}
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
    t = c(0, 0.19, 0.4, 0.56, 0.65, 1),
    y = speed(t) + 5,
    label=c("", "A", "B", "C", "D", "")
)
slice_plot(speed(t) ~ t, domain(t=c(0,1)), npts=500) %>%
    gf_labs(y = "Instantaneous rate of change (miles/hour)", 
           x = "Time since start of trip.") %>%
    gf_text(2 ~ t, data = Pts, label=~label, color="blue") %>%
    gf_segment(5 + y ~ t + t, data = Pts[-1,], color="blue")
```
The two graphs in Figures \@ref{fig:stop-and-go} and \@ref{fig:instant-speed} show exactly the same car trip. The presentation of the data in the different graphs makes it easy to see some things and hard to see others. For instance, figuring out when the car is at a stand-still is harder in the position-vs-time graph than in the speed-vs-time graph. This is very much in the spirit of the sand-furrows example at the start of this chapter: it's much easier to perceive the furrows because the lighting highlights areas sloping toward the sun as bright and areas sloping away from the sun as dark. In Figure \@ref{fig:instant-speed} we're not using light-and-dark for the display. Instead, we're showing the instantaneous speed as the vertical position 

Recall that the interval between $t_B$ and $t_C$ had an ***average rate of change*** of about 39 miles-per-hour. Looking at the ***instantaneous rate of change*** tells the story differently: at time $t_B$ the car was accelerating to about 60 miles-per-hour. Then it gradually slowed, coming to a stop just before time $t_C$.

Figure \@ref{fig:stop-and-go} shows the function $\mbox{position}(t)$. Figure \@ref{fig:instant-speed} shows a different function, $\mbox{speed}(t)$. Although the two functions are different, they are intimately related: $\mbox{speed}(t)$ is the ***instantaneous rate of change*** of $\mbox{position}(t)$. 

Two central operations in calculus are:

1. Given a function $f(t)$, find the function $g(t)$ giving the instantaneous rate of change of $f()$. This process of deriving $g(t)$ from $f(t)$ is called ***differentiation***.
2. Given a function $g(t)$, find the $f(t)$ of which $g(t)$ is the instantaneous rate of change. This process of finding $f()$ given $g()$ is called ***anti-differentiation***.

YOU WERE WORKING HERE.

Sometimes, working with the average-rate-of-growth function directly tells you what you need. Other times, you need to extend your model. 

Between year 30 and 32, there is hardly any change in the value of the average-rate-of-change function. It's increasing a little, but is it really worthwhile to wait. One argument is that at year 29 you already have a valuable resource: wood that could be money in the bank. If the money were in the bank, you could invest it and earn more money *and* at the same time get a new seedling in the ground to start its growth. You're doing two things at once. Efficient!

To know what is the best year for harvest from this point of view, you want to calculate the effective "interest rate" on the present amount of wood that you earn in the form of new wood. That interest rate is the
