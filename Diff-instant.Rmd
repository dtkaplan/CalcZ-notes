# Instantaneous rate of change

## From average to instant

YOU HAVE KNOWN HOW TO CALCULATE AN AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE for a long time. But possibly you don't yet fully know what the **use** of such a calculation is other than to help you pass a math test. In this section, we're going to show how to calculate the ***instantaneous rate of change*** function and show some of the many things this is useful for.

To orient you to what's going to happen ...

1. We're going to set up the familiar average-rate-of-change calculation in a new framework.
2. Using that framework, you'll be able to calculate an average-rate-of-change *function*.
3. Then, by turning a knob on the calculation in (2), you'll be able to calculate the ***instantaneous*** rate of change function. By the way, the knob is called $h$.

In short, this section will introduce you to the operation called ***differentiation***.

## The $h$ framework

Calculating an average rate of change involved specifying an interval of the function domain: the left side $t_A$ and the right side $t_B$. Let's change this notation a little:

- Left endpoint of domain: $t_0$
- Right endpoint of domain: $t_0 + h$

There is nothing fundamentally new here. The interval is still specified by two numbers, but now they are called $t_0$ and $h$. The width of the interval is just $h$, which is a little easier to write than $t_B - t_A$, but is still just the width.

The ***average rate of change*** in the new notation is $$\frac{f(t_0 + h) - f(t_0)}{h}\ \ \mbox{rather than}\ \ \frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}$$

Why are you using $t$ instead of $x$?

Remember, the *name* of an input can be anything at all so long as you use it consistently on the left side of $\equiv$ and on the right side. All of these are the same definition:
$$g(t) \equiv e^{kt},\ \ g(x) \equiv e^{kx},\ \ g(y) \equiv e^{ky},\ \ g(\mbox{altitude}) \equiv e^{k\,{\small{\text{altitude}}}}$$
When we work with functions of two or more variables, it will be essential to give easily distinguished names to the inputs. We're trying to get you in the habit of paying attention to the names of inputs and break a *bad habit* from high-school math of calling the input $x$ and the output $y$.
:::

Now we are going to make a small, subtle, and important change. Instead of thinking of the average rate of change *at a specific interval* $t_0$ to $t_0 + h$, we're going to write an average-rate-of-change ***function***. And since we're in the habit of giving *names* to functions, we'll be careful to name average-rate-of-change functions in a way that makes explicit the connection to the function $f(t)$ whose rate of change is being calculated. 

Our convention will be to use two additional components in the names of average-rate-of-change functions. The first component is to lead with a "D" in a caligraphic font: $\cal D$. The second component will be the name of the input whose interval is being used in calculating the rate of change. So ...

$${\cal D}_t\, f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}$$
You can pronounce ${\cal D}_t$ as "difference with respect to $t$." But remember that the function name is the whole deal, ${\cal D}_t\, f()$, which is to be read as "difference with respect to $t$ of $f()$." Admittedly a long name. Don't be surprised later when we start using *nicknames* like Liz (for Elizabeth) or Bill (for William). For instance, later we'll save ink and breath by using the nickname $\dot{f}()$ instead of ${\cal D}_t\, f()$.



FOLLOWING NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT ...


From the way we've defined ${\cal D}_t f(t)$, it's reasonable to assume that $h$ is a ***parameter***: a symbol naming a numerical value that has to be specified before ${\cal D}_t\, f(t)$ can be evaluated at a specific $t$. 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Find an average-rate-of-change function with respect to $x$ of $g(x) \equiv x^2$. 

$${\cal D}_x g(x) = \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h$$
:::


I like to think of $h$ as a kind of *tire iron*, a small tool used to stretch the bead of a bicycle tire in order to pull it over the wheel rim. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="A tire iron in use", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/tire-iron.png")
```

Once the tire iron has done its job, it's removed and you would never know that it was ever there (except that the tire is now successfully mounted on the wheel).

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Find an average-rate-of-change function with respect to $x$ of $g(x) \equiv x^2$, but remove the tire iron $h$ when you're done. 

$${\cal D}_x g(x) 
= \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{stretch $x$ a bit}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{pull over rim}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} \ \ \mbox{still pulling ...}\\
= 2 x + h \ \ \mbox{success!}$$

Now remove the tire iron to get $${\cal D}_x g(x) = 2x$$.
:::

But this is calculus, not bicycle mechanics. How do we know that removing the tire iron isn't damaging the mathematical wheel? Historically, this has been a serious debate, resolved only with great difficulty more than a century after calculus started being used successfully. 

Still in the spirit of having fun, let's try a more serious metaphor... imagining $h$ is actually a central character in a calculus play. The character $h$ is in the middle of the story but *never appears in the play*, like the missing character Godot in the famous play *[Waiting for Godot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot#Godot)*. 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
We said that $h$ in the finite rate of change function ${\cal D}_x g()$, so long as $h$ is small, plays both a central role and has hardly any effect. An economizing director re-writes the play to take $h$ out of it, setting $h=0$: a non-speaking, offstage role.

We've already seen using legitimate algebra that $${\cal D}_x g(x) = 2 x + h$$. Re-writing by replacing $h$ with 0 streamlines the play, turning $\Delta g()$ from a dialog involving both $x$ and $h$ into a monologue with $h$ absent: $$\{cal D} g(x) = 2 x$$. Simple.

And yet ... the director gets a letter from the Actors Equity Union. 

> *We observe that you have eliminated the role of $h$ in the final production version of ${\cal D}_x g(x)$. This is a violation of Union regulations. Recall that the rate-of-change function ${\cal D}_x g(x)$ is defined as a ratio: $${\cal D}_x g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}$$ Although the name $h$ does not need to appear in the argument list of ${\cal D}_x g(x)$, eliminating $h$ entirely by replacing her with zero is a **division by zero error** forbidden by Article 3.16§B¶2 of the Unified Laws of Arithmetic. We ask that you comply with this Article by re-instating the role of $h$ in all evaluations of ${\cal D} g(x)$.*

Reading this, the director calls her lawyer. Is there a loophole for removing $h$ without breaking the mathematical prohibition on dividing by zero?

YOU GOT HERE.

## The $\Delta$ operator

Up until now, we used only functions that take numerical quantities as inputs and produce a numerical quantity as an output. It's time now to broaden our perspective a bit.

Imagine a function named $\Delta()$ defined like this:
$$\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
$\Delta()$ takes as input a **function**. You might have guessed this because the definition uses the name $f$ for the input to $\Delta()$, but the name of an input does not matter so long as it is used consistently in the body of the function. Looking at the body, you can that the name $f$ is being used (twice!) in the position of a function's name.

For instance:

- $\Delta(\sin) = \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}$
- $\Delta(x^2) = \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}$
- $\Delta(a + b x) = \frac{a + b(x + h) - \left(a + b x\right)}{h}$

::: {.why latex-data=""}
Why did you use $=$ in the above statements rather than the $\equiv$?

$\equiv$ means "is defined as" or "is the name of." When we wrote $$\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$ we were giving a name to a function. But writing $\Delta(a + b x)$ means to apply the already defined function $\Delta$ to an input, that input being the straight-line function $a + b x$. Rather than *defining* what is $\Delta(a + b x)$ we are *deducing* it from objects that have already been defined.
:::

What is the output of $\Delta()$? It takes a *function* as an input and returns ... a function as an output.

We might choose to give a name to the output, for example fred() or betty() or, more helpfully, $\mbox{rate}_\sin$ or $\Delta \sin$, but our naming conventions, particularly the use of $x$ indicate that \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}$ is a function.

In calculus, there are a handful of celebrity functions that take a function as input and return a function as output. Notice that the word "function" appeared three times in the previous sentence. To avoid this sort of sleep-inducing repetition, we'll call such functions ***operators***. 

> An ***operator*** (as we will use the word) is a function that, like all functions, has an input and an output. The input is itself a function, the output is also a function, typically (but not always) different from the input.

Lidar measured distance to ground. The function value doesn't really matter. What matters is how the value at a point relates to the values at nearby points. Seeing this difference is how you can spot the Maya ruins.

Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía/Nacional Center for Airborne Laser Mapping

"The map, published in 2011 by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography, covered 4,440 square miles in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas. It was made as part of the institute’s mission to create accurate maps to be used by businesses and researchers.

"Dr. Inomata learned about the map from Rodrigo Liendo, an archaeologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The resolution of the map was low. But the outlines of countless archaeological sites stood out to Dr. Inomata. So far, he has used it to identify the ruins of 27 previously unknown Maya ceremonial centers that contain a type of construction that archaeologists had never seen before. These sites may hold insights into the origins of Maya civilization."
