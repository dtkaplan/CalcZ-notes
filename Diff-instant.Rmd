# Instantaneous rate of change

## Average $\rightarrow$ instant

YOU HAVE KNOWN HOW TO CALCULATE AN AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE for a long time. But possibly you don't yet fully know what the **use** of such a calculation is other than to help you pass a math test. In this section, we're going to show how to calculate the ***instantaneous rate of change*** function and show some of the many things this is useful for.

To orient you to what's going to happen ...

1. We're going to set up the familiar average-rate-of-change calculation in a new framework.
2. Using that framework, you'll be able to calculate an average-rate-of-change *function*.
3. Then, by turning a knob on the calculation in (2), you'll be able to calculate the ***instantaneous*** rate of change function. By the way, the knob is called $h$.

In short, this section will introduce you to the operation called ***differentiation***.

FOLLOWING NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT ...

Comparing the value of a function $f()$ at two inputs is a matter of evaluating the function at two inputs, say $x_0$ and $x_1$. Often, our interest is in comparing the output at two ***nearby*** inputs. To convey this idea of nearby, we can write the two nearby inputs as $x_0$ and $x_0 + h$. The lower-case letter $h$ will be used throughout these notes to signify a ***small*** increment, typically positive, in the input to a function. (Note: The function $h()$ is not necessarily about small increments. It's just a generic pronoun for a function.)

The ***finite difference*** between function outputs at the two nearby inputs is $f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)$. We could just as well consider $f(x_0) - f(x_0 - h)$. Are these two differences the same? That depends on the function $f()$.

Consider the simple A/B combination of a power-law function and a constant function: $g(x) \equiv x^2 + 3$. Taking $h$ to be 0.1 and $x_0$ to be 1, what is the finite difference of $g(x)$? How about for $h=0.01$?

The finite difference  is $$g(x_0 + h) - g(x_0) = (x_0 + h)^2 + 3 - \left(x_0^2 + 3\right)$$
When $h=1$ this gives $$1.1^2 + 3 - (1.1 +3) = 1.21 - 1.1 = 0.21$$ When $h=1.01$ it is $$1.01^2 - 1.01 = 1.0201 - 1.01 = 0.0101$$
:::

We will often need to consider the finite difference as a function. This involves making a tiny change in notation. Instead of $x_0$, which by our notation convention suggests a *specific value* for the input, we'll write $x$ as in $$f(x+h) - f(x)$$ 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Continuing the previous example ... What is the finite difference function for $g(x)$? Evaluate it at $x = 1$ and $2$ with $h=0.10$ and $h=0.01$ 

The formula, as we have seen, is $$(x+h)^2 + 3 - \left(x^2 + 3\right) = x^2 + 2h x + h^2 + 3 - (x^2 + 3) = 2h x + h^2$$

Evaluating this:

* At $x=1$: 

    - For $h=0.10$ the finite difference function evaluates to $2 \times 0.1 \times 1 + 0.1^2 = 0.2 + 0.01 = 0.21$. 
    - Setting $h=0.01$  gives $2 \times 0.01 \times 1 + 0.01^2 = 0.0201$.

* At $x=2$: 

    - For $h=0.10$ the finite difference function evaluates to $2 \times 0.1 \times 2 + 0.1^2 = 0.4 + 0.01 = 0.041$. 
    - For $h=0.01$, it is $2 \times 0.01 \times 2 + 0.01^2 = 0.0401$.

As you can see, the value of the finite difference function depends both on $x$ *and on* $h$. Not a surprize. When $h=0.01$ the values are roughly 10-times smaller than for $h=0.10$.
:::

This idea of a ***finite-difference function*** is mainly just a step on the path to another kind of function that will be of primary importance in calculus, the ***finite rate of change***, often called the ***average rate of change***: $$\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$
Recognize this as "rise over run," in other words a "slope."

Let's give this particular function a name to help us talk about it. A tradition is to use a Greek letter, $\Delta$ ("delta"), here. The finite rate of change function for $f()$ is $$\Delta f(x) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$ In computer notation, we might write `delta_f()`. Remember, $\Delta f$ is just the **name** we've given to the function. Any other name could have been used.

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Find the finite rate of change function for $g(x)$ and evaluate it at $x=1$ for $h=0.1$ and $h=0.01$.

Following the $\Delta$ naming convention, we'll call the finite rate of change function $$\Delta g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} = \frac{2 h x + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h$$

Evaluating $\Delta g(1)$ for $h=0.10$ and $h=0.01$, we get:

- $h=0.10$ gives $2 + 0.10 = 2.10$
- $h=0.01$ gives $2 + 0.01 = 2.01$

In contrast to the finite difference function, where $h$ strongly shapes the output, for the finite rate of change function $h$ hardly matters at all!
:::

From the way we've defined $\Delta f(x)$, it's reasonable to assume that $h$ is a ***parameter***: a symbol naming a numerical value that has to be specified before $\Delta f(x)$ can be evaluated at a specific $x$. But $h$ actually is a character in the play of calculus, a character that plays a central role but whose numerical value is usually of no interest whatsoever besides being "small." 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
We said that $h$ in the finite rate of change function $\Delta g()$, so long as $h$ is small, plays both a central role and has hardly any effect. An economizing director, re-writes the play to take $h$ out of it, setting $h=0$: a non-speaking role. With this choice, what's $\Delta g(x)$?

We've already seen that $$\Delta g(x) = 2 x + h$$ Re-writing by replacing $h$ with 0 streamlines the play, turning $\Delta g()$ from a dialog into a monologue: $\Delta g(x) = 2 x$. Simple.

And yet ... the director gets a letter from the Actors Equity Union. 

> *We observe that you have eliminated the role of $h$ from your play. This is in violation of Union regulations. Recall that a finite rate of change function $\Delta g(x)$ is defined as a ratio: $$\Delta g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}$$ Although the name $h$ does not need to appear in the argument list of $\Delta g(x)$, eliminating $h$ entirely by replacing her with zero is a **division by zero error** forbidden by Article 3.16§B¶2 of the Unified Laws of Arithmetic. We ask that you comply with this Article by re-instating the role of $h$ in all evaluations of $\Delta g(x)$.*

Reading this, the director calls her lawyer. Is there a loophole to deal with Article 3.16§B¶2 without $h$?

## The $\Delta$ operator

Up until now, we used only functions that take numerical quantities as inputs and produce a numerical quantity as an output. It's time now to broaden our perspective a bit.

Imagine a function named $\Delta()$ defined like this:
$$\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$
$\Delta()$ takes as input a **function**. You might have guessed this because the definition uses the name $f$ for the input to $\Delta()$, but the name of an input does not matter so long as it is used consistently in the body of the function. Looking at the body, you can that the name $f$ is being used (twice!) in the position of a function's name.

For instance:

- $\Delta(\sin) = \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}$
- $\Delta(x^2) = \frac{(x+h)^2 - x^2}{h}$
- $\Delta(a + b x) = \frac{a + b(x + h) - \left(a + b x\right)}{h}$

::: {.why latex-data=""}
Why did you use $=$ in the above statements rather than the $\equiv$?

$\equiv$ means "is defined as" or "is the name of." When we wrote $$\Delta(f) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$ we were giving a name to a function. But writing $\Delta(a + b x)$ means to apply the already defined function $\Delta$ to an input, that input being the straight-line function $a + b x$. Rather than *defining* what is $\Delta(a + b x)$ we are *deducing* it from objects that have already been defined.
:::

What is the output of $\Delta()$? It takes a *function* as an input and returns ... a function as an output.

We might choose to give a name to the output, for example fred() or betty() or, more helpfully, $\mbox{rate}_\sin$ or $\Delta \sin$, but our naming conventions, particularly the use of $x$ indicate that \frac{\sin(x+h) - \sin(x)}{h}$ is a function.

In calculus, there are a handful of celebrity functions that take a function as input and return a function as output. Notice that the word "function" appeared three times in the previous sentence. To avoid this sort of sleep-inducing repetition, we'll call such functions ***operators***. 

> An ***operator*** (as we will use the word) is a function that, like all functions, has an input and an output. The input is itself a function, the output is also a function, typically (but not always) different from the input.

Lidar measured distance to ground. The function value doesn't really matter. What matters is how the value at a point relates to the values at nearby points. Seeing this difference is how you can spot the Maya ruins.

"The map, published in 2011 by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography, covered 4,440 square miles in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas. It was made as part of the institute’s mission to create accurate maps to be used by businesses and researchers.

"Dr. Inomata learned about the map from Rodrigo Liendo, an archaeologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The resolution of the map was low. But the outlines of countless archaeological sites stood out to Dr. Inomata. So far, he has used it to identify the ruins of 27 previously unknown Maya ceremonial centers that contain a type of construction that archaeologists had never seen before. These sites may hold insights into the origins of Maya civilization."
