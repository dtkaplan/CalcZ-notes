You have known how to calculate an average rate of change for a long time. But possibly you don't yet fully know what the **use** of such a calculation is other than to help you pass a math test. In this section, we're going to show how to calculate the ***instantaneous rate of change*** function and show some of the many things this is useful for.

To orient you to what's going to happen ...

1. We're going to set up the familiar average-rate-of-change calculation in a new framework.
2. Using that framework, you'll be able to calculate an average-rate-of-change *function*.
3. Then, by turning a knob on the calculation in (2), you'll be able to calculate the ***instantaneous*** rate of change function. By the way, the knob is called $h$.

In short, this section will introduce you to the operation called ***differentiation***.

## The $h$ framework

Calculating an average rate of change involved specifying an interval of the function domain: the left side $t_A$ and the right side $t_B$. Let's change this notation a little:

- Left endpoint of domain: $t_0$
- Right endpoint of domain: $t_0 + h$

There is nothing fundamentally new here. The interval is still specified by two numbers, but now they are called $t_0$ and $h$. The width of the interval is just $h$, which is a little easier to write than $t_B - t_A$, but is still just the width.

The ***average rate of change*** in the new notation is $$\frac{f(t_0 + h) - f(t_0)}{h}\ \ \mbox{rather than}\ \ \frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}$$

::: {.why latex-data=""}
Why are you using $t$ instead of $x$?

Remember, the *name* of an input can be anything at all so long as you use it consistently on the left side of $\equiv$ and on the right side. All of these are the same definition:
$$g(t) \equiv e^{kt},\ \ g(x) \equiv e^{kx},\ \ g(y) \equiv e^{ky},\ \ g(\mbox{altitude}) \equiv e^{k\,{\small{\text{altitude}}}}$$
When we work with functions of two or more variables, it will be essential to give easily distinguished names to the inputs. We're trying to get you in the habit of paying attention to the names of inputs and break a *bad habit* from high-school math of calling the input $x$ and the output $y$.
:::

Now we are going to make a small, subtle, and important change. Instead of thinking of the average rate of change *at a specific interval* $t_0$ to $t_0 + h$, we're going to write an average-rate-of-change ***function***. And since we're in the habit of giving *names* to functions, we'll be careful to name average-rate-of-change functions in a way that makes explicit the connection to the function $f(t)$ whose rate of change is being calculated. 

Our convention will be to use two additional components in the names of average-rate-of-change functions. The first component is to lead with a "D" in a caligraphic font: $\cal D$. The second component will be the name of the input whose interval is being used in calculating the rate of change. So ...

$${\cal D}_t\, f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}$$
You can pronounce ${\cal D}_t$ as "difference with respect to $t$." But remember that the function name is the whole deal, ${\cal D}_t\, f()$, which is to be read as "difference with respect to $t$ of $f()$." Admittedly a long name. Don't be surprised later when we start using *nicknames* like Liz (for Elizabeth) or Bill (for William). For instance, later we'll save ink and breath by using the nickname $\dot{f}()$ instead of ${\cal D}_t\, f()$.



FOLLOWING NEEDS TO BE SORTED OUT ...


From the way we've defined ${\cal D}_t f(t)$, it's reasonable to assume that $h$ is a ***parameter***: a symbol naming a numerical value that has to be specified before ${\cal D}_t\, f(t)$ can be evaluated at a specific $t$. 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Find a formula for ${\cal D}_x\, g(t)$the average-rate-of-change function with respect to $x$ of $g(x) \equiv x^2$. 

$${\cal D}_x g(x) = \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h$$
:::


I like to think of $h$ as a kind of *tire iron*, a small tool used to stretch the bead of a bicycle tire in order to pull it over the wheel rim. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.cap="A tire iron in use", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/tire-iron.png")
```

Once the tire iron has done its job, it's removed and you would never know that it was ever there (except that the tire is now successfully mounted on the wheel).

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
Find an average-rate-of-change function with respect to $x$ of $g(x) \equiv x^2$, but remove the tire iron $h$ when you're done. 

$${\cal D}_x g(x) 
= \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{stretch $x$ a bit}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{pull over rim}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} \ \ \mbox{still pulling ...}\\
= 2 x + h \ \ \mbox{success!}$$

Now remove the tire iron to get $${\cal D}_x g(x) = 2x$$.
:::

But this is calculus, not bicycle mechanics. How do we know that removing the tire iron isn't damaging the mathematical wheel? Historically, this has been a serious debate, resolved only with great difficulty more than a century after calculus started being used successfully. 

Still in the spirit of having fun, let's try a more serious metaphor... imagining $h$ is actually a central character in a calculus play. The character $h$ is in the middle of the story but *never appears in the play*, like the missing character Godot in the famous play *[Waiting for Godot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot#Godot)*. 

::: {.workedexample latex-data=""}
We said that $h$ in the finite rate of change function ${\cal D}_x g()$, so long as $h$ is small, plays both a central role and has hardly any effect. An economizing director re-writes the play to take $h$ out of it, setting $h=0$: a non-speaking, offstage role.

We've already seen using legitimate algebra that $${\cal D}_x g(x) = 2 x + h$$ Re-writing by replacing $h$ with 0 streamlines the play, turning $\Delta g()$ from a dialog involving both $x$ and $h$ into a monologue with $h$ absent: $${\cal D}_x g(x) = 2 x$$ Simple.

And yet ... the director gets a letter from the Bit Players Union. 

> *We observe that you have eliminated the role of $h$ in the final production version of ${\cal D}_x g(x)$. This is a violation of Union regulations. Recall that the rate-of-change function ${\cal D}_x g(x)$ is defined as a ratio: $${\cal D}_x g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}$$ Although the name $h$ does not need to appear in the argument list of ${\cal D}_x g(x)$, eliminating $h$ entirely by replacing her with zero is a **division by zero error** forbidden by Article 3.16§B¶2 of the Unified Laws of Arithmetic. We ask that you comply with this Article by re-instating the role of $h$ in all evaluations of ${\cal D} g(x)$.*

Reading this, the director calls her lawyer. Is there a loophole for removing $h$ without breaking the mathematical prohibition on dividing by zero?

## The derivative operator

Let's put aside for the moment the issue of the disappearing $h$. 

::: {.forinstructor latex-data=""}
Historically, such "putting aside" has incurred a great deal of criticism. In 1734, famous philosopher [George Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley) (1685-1753) published a long-titled book: *The Analyst: A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician: Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and Inferences of the Modern Analysis Are More Distinctly Conceived, or More Evidently Deduced, Than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith*. In *The Analyst*, Berkeley took issue with the arguments of that time that it is legitimate to divide by $h$ when, ultimately, $h$ will be replaced by zero. Calling $h$ an "evanescent increment," he asked, 

> *"And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?"*

Interesting, Berkeley believed that the ghost of $h$ yielded correct results. His objection was that the framers of calculus had made two, canceling errors. 

> *"[B]y virtue of a two fold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet truth."*

Berkeley was saying that calculus had not yet been put on a solid logical foundation. It was to be more than a century after Berkeley's death until this work was accomplished. Once accomplished, the results that had been claimed true all along were confirmed.

I propose that we start with the results, which is what everyone *uses*. Later, we can introduce the new concepts on which the new logic was based. The names of the concepts---continuity, smoothness, singularity---are widely and effectively used in talking about functions, but the names, like many words in English, can be put to good and accurate use without memorizing the precise definitions.
:::

On to the results ...

1. Every "smooth" function $h(x)$ has a corresponding function that is its derivative $\partial_x h(x)$.
2. Finding the algorithm for $\partial_x h(x)$, called ***differentiating $h()$***, is *automatic* in the sense that it can be done by computer without human intervention or judgment. 
3. When there is an algebraic formula for $h(x)$, the computer can find the algebraic formula for $\partial_x h(x)$. This is called ***symbolic differentiation***.
4. When there is no algebraic formula for $h()$, the computer can use ***numerical differentiation*** which involves a non-zero $h$. The results of numerical differentiation on functions with formulas can differ subtly from the results from symbolic differentiation. Usually the difference is too small to notice, but in extreme cases it is not. It's important for the user of numerical differentiation to know how to identify extreme cases and deal with them.
5. The derivatives of each of the basic modeling functions (aside from $\text{hump}()$) can be expressed in terms of a basic modeling function.


> An ***operator*** (as we will use the word) is a function that, like all functions, has an input and an output. The input is itself a function, the output is also a function, typically (but not always) different from the input.

Lidar measured distance to ground. The function value doesn't really matter. What matters is how the value at a point relates to the values at nearby points. Seeing this difference is how you can spot the Maya ruins.

"The map, published in 2011 by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography, covered 4,440 square miles in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas. It was made as part of the institute’s mission to create accurate maps to be used by businesses and researchers.

"Dr. Inomata learned about the map from Rodrigo Liendo, an archaeologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The resolution of the map was low. But the outlines of countless archaeological sites stood out to Dr. Inomata. So far, he has used it to identify the ruins of 27 previously unknown Maya ceremonial centers that contain a type of construction that archaeologists had never seen before. These sites may hold insights into the origins of Maya civilization."
