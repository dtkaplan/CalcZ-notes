This section is for development purposes only. It is not to be included in the released text.

This outline was that established during the May 17-19, 2021 working sessions at USAFA. It's copied directly from the Teams document. I've made some modifications which are noted in [[square brackets]] for deletions and **bold face** for additions..

Block 1 Functions and Mathematical Modeling

1. Intro to the course
    a. Topics
        i. Course trajectory
        ii. Linear Function is the model for “change”
    b. Reading: Chapter \@ref(change)

2. Basic**s of** modeling functions
    a. NTI:
        i. **Modeling functions**
        i. **Graphics**
        i. [[Introduce the idea of asymptotic behavior using the terminology of "limits"]] Moved to Section \@ref{sec:asymptotes_of_functions} 
    b. Readings: Section \@ref(naked-intro) and Chapter \@ref(fun-describing)

3. Functions as I/O and Notational Structure of functions (R<>Math)
    a. Topics
        i. **Graphics and graphs** 
        i. [[Polynomials]] moved to linear combinations
        #. Introduce Multi-input functions notation
        #. Distinguish between mathematical symbols: $=$, $\equiv$, \rightarrow$, `<-` See Secton \@ref(foursigns)
    b. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-notation) & \@ref(graphs-and-graphics)
    c. To do:
        - Provide glossary of notation across 6-blocks (+alternate forms)

4. Parameterized functions as models (eqn, params, data, applications)
    a. NTI
        i. Introduce idea that input has meaning, and output has meaning relative to the input
        ii. Give students a function. Then change the units of input to a different unit (e.g. feet go to Meters)
    b. Objectives:
        i. Linear
        i. Sine
        i. Power
        i. Exponential
        i. Logarithmic
    c. Reading: Chapter \@ref(params-intro)

5. Combining 2+ functions
    a. Examples:
    b. NTIs:
    c. Topics:
        i. Linear Combination (ex: Polynomial)
        ii. Composition with scaling function ($e^{kt})
            1. Gallons/$ to Liters/Euros
        iii. Composition (affine shift)
            1. Fahrenheit <> Celsius

6. Slope function
    a. NTI:
        i. How do broaden the idea of describing the slope of a line to a general function?
        ii. No $h$ at this point
        iii. The slope function is a function $s()$  which is built from a function $f()$
    b. Topics
        i. $s(x) \equiv \frac{f(x + 0.1) - f(x)}{0.1}$
        ii. **Every function has a slope function.**
        iii. **It's helpful to name functions so we know where they come from. We're going to use $f'()$ to stand for the slope function of $f()$**
    c. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-slopes)

7. Composition Generally
    a. NTI:
        i. What temperature is it while driving up a mountain?
        ii. Problem where they are calculating the slope of a sigmoid
    b. Topics:
        i. Formula for Hump (exponential with a quadratic)
        ii. **Driving up a mountain** temperature vs altitude, altitude vs road position, road position vs time
        iii. Hump is the slope function of Sigmoid 
    c. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-assembling)

8. Multiplication of functions
    a. NTIs:
        i. Multiplication about Sines, exponential, hump, sigmoid
    b. Topics:
        i. Multiplying functions **of the same inputs** gives a function of those inputs.
        ii. **Multiplying functions of different inputs** gives a function whose inputs are the union of the inputs to the multiplicands.
    c. Be able to reverse engineer these products: sin*exp, sin*hump*, sin*sigmoid
    d. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-assembling)

9. Multivariate functions
    a. NTIs:
        i. Ask students how they compute the slope of a multi-input function as best they can imagine how (homework?) Build their imagined function (for the slope) and plot the function
    b. Outcomes:
        i. Be able to read & construct (in R) Contour Plots
        ii. Be able to read & construct (in R) Surface Plots
        iii. Be able to read a table w/ 2 inputs
    c. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-multiple-inputs)
    
10. Piecewise functions [jettison if needed in favor of doing this as homework]
    a. Topics
        i. Construct and evaluate piecewise functions
        ii. Demonstrate how to implement in R
    b. Outcomes:
        i. Be able to identify break(s) of a piecewise function

::: {.takenote}
One of our highlighting formats, called `::: {.takenote}` is being used as a clear statement of basic skills that a students should master. It might be good to tie quizzes to these and *vice versa*.
