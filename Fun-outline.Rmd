This outline was that established during the May 17-19, 2021 working sessions at USAFA. It's copied directly from the Teams document. I've made some modifications which are noted in [[square brackets]] for deletions and **bold face** for additions..

Block 1 Functions and Mathematical Modeling

1. Intro to the course
    a. NTI
        i. We can make the point about Linear Function is the model for change by drawing pictures or discussing how certain quantities change between two points in time
        i. The discussion about Calc Z should not be about "How is Z different", but "Z is the new Calculus to which USAFA is transitioning; you may see differences between this course and the traditional course that some of your peers are taking."
        i. Oveall goal for day 1 is to build cadet's confidence that they can be successful. This requires us to show them the systems, resources, philosophy, and expectations (e.g., college $\neq$ high school) behind the course.
    a. Lecture Topics
        i. Calculus Z overview and trajectory
        i. Course resources and systems
        i. Calculus is the study of change
        i. Linear Function is the model for “change” because it has "slope"
    a. Outcomes
        i. Understand than an equation relates quantities, but a function maps inputs to outputs
        i. Understand the difference between $\equiv$ and $=$
        i. Be able to identify a function's input
    a. Readings (assigned M1, skim before, read after)
        i. Chapter \@ref(change)
    a. Additional Resources
        i. None
    a. Assignments
        i. HW01
        i. Feedback01
        i. DD01

2. Basics of modeling functions
    a. NTI
        i. Emphasize that functions map inputs to outputs, but the naked functions are (by themselves) not flexible enough for most circumstances
        i. Show students graph of 5 naked functions, have them pick which is which. (Use e.g. `slice_plot(sin(x) ~ x), domain(x=c(-5,5)))`)
        i. Point out that a *truly* naked straight-line is just $x$, and use that as the introduction to parameterization
        i. Show scatter plot of $f(x)\equiv -x+2$ and explain why $f(x)\equiv x$ is not a good model to motivate basic modeling function. [[[Do we want to make up data for this scatter plot? If so, `Mydata <- tibble(x = rnorm(100), y = -2*x + rnorm(100)/10)`]]] See [book position 295](https://dtkaplan.github.io/CalcZ-notes/naked-intro.html#295) for some actual data.
    a. Lecture Topics
        i. Naked modeling functions
        ii. **Basic shapes and features** such as zero crossings, maxima, slope, curvature, horizontal/vertical asymptote (if any). (It's the vocabulary that we want them to know at this point.)
        i. [[Basic Modeling functions and their behaviors based on their parameters]]-save this for another day.
    a. Outcomes
        i. Know graphs, domains, ranges, horizonal/vertical intercepts & asymptotes (if any) for all the naked modeling functions
        i. Recognize that functions are a way of modeling relationships in the real-world
        i. [Given parameters, describe how those parameters affect the shape of the function]]-save this for another day
    a. Readings:  Chapter \@ref(naked-intro)
    a. Additional Resources
        i. [PDF - Exponential Functions Deep Dive](https://usafa0.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/Math142ZFall2021-CalculusI/EfEx-HgBYHNDn2BS4Kadmx0Bytv7CScY0VVyFbngc2GLUw?e=9nDd3s)
        i. [Math Insight - Logarithm basics](https://mathinsight.org/logarithm_basics)
        i. [Khan Academy - Properties of Logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:logs#x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:log-prop)
        i. **RESOURCE FOR TRIG VALUES (TRIG TABLE)**
    a. Assignments
        i. Problems at end of chapter (to be written)
    a. Quiz question: Which of these functions have horizontal asymptotes? [Give a list, ask them to circle.] Similar for vertical asymptote.

3. Functions as I/O and Notational Structure of functions (R<>Math)
    a. NTI
        i. Rewrite $y=mx+b$ as $mx-y+b=0$ to show function notation eliminates ambiguity of IO
        i. Break student habit of using "x-axis" or "y-axis"; describe these as "horizontal" or "vertical" axes
        i. Break student habit of using "x" and "y"; instead they should say "input" and "output"
        i. Explain that parameters scale or shift inputs/outputs. Ex: the $C$ in $Ce^{kt}$ scales the output and the $k$ scales the input
        i. Example function without a formula: $f:Cadet\to RoomNumber$
    a. Topics
        i. Functions as Input and Ouptut (IO)
        i. Introduce Multi-input functions
        i. Function Representations
        i. Notation and Conventions
        i. Distinguish between mathematical symbols: $=$, $\equiv$, \rightarrow$, `<-` See Secton \@ref(foursigns)
    a. Outcomes
        i. Understand that a function maps inputs to outputs
        i. Given an input, be able to find the output of a function in any one of the five standard forms:
            - Graphs of functions (including contour plots)
            - Tables of inputs and outputs
            - Word descriptions
            - Computer function name
            - Mathematical notation
        i. Be able to translate between traditional math notation and R expressions
    a. Reading: Chapter \@ref(fun-notation) & \@ref(graphs-and-graphics)
    a. To do:
        - Provide glossary of notation across 6-blocks (+alternate forms)
    a. Assignments
        i. DD03
        
QUIZ: Draw reasonable sketches of all nine naked modeling functions. In addition to the overall shape of the function, label one point  on the graph with its exact output value. (Hint: for $\dnorm(x)$, the highest possible output is 0.3989423.)
    
4. Parameterized functions as models
    a. NTI
        i. Introduce idea that input has meaning, and output has meaning relative to the input
        i. Give students a function. Then change the units of input to a different unit (e.g. feet go to Meters)
        i. Logarithms are not necessarily used as the end model; they are the lever which seperate power from exponential functions
            - TODO: Think about physical phenomenon that would appropriately be modeled by a Logarithmic function or power with $p<1$
        i. Focus the lesson entirely on finding parameters for Sine, Power, and Exponential
    a. Lecture Topics:
        i. Modeling phenomenon with the basic modeling functions

One of our highlighting formats, called `::: {.takenote}` is being used as a clear statement of basic skills that a students should master. It might be good to tie quizzes to these and *vice versa*.
