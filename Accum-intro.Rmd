::: {.todo}
Pick up on the Lorenz curve `{.intheworld}` in Blocks 1 and 2. Integrate to find the Gini coefficient. Show that the Gini coefficient is the same for very different types of inequality and that therefore it's not such a good measure. How about the integral over the poorest 25% or 50% of society."
