# Differential modeling {#differential-modeling}

We've already seen several calculus-related strategies that address important modeling scenarios, for example translating a setting into a "target problem" in linear algebra, modeling using low-order polynomials, using power transformations (e.g. $\sqrt()$ or $\ln()$) to refine models, and so on.

In this chapter, we're going to elaborate on a strategy called "differential modeling" that has already appeared implicitly in many problems.

You've already seen differential modeling at work in calculating areas and other sorts of accumulation. The setting should be familiar at this point. We have a function $f(x)$ and we wish to accumulate it over some interval in $x$, say $a \leq x \leq b$. Such accumulation problems are very simply stated: $$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$ This is really just a matter of notation; the use of the integral sign doesn't convey any more information than the phrase "accumulate $f(x)$."

You've also learned some techniques for doing the calculation called for by $\int_a^b f(x) dx$. One such technique is anti-differentiation to construct a new function $F(x)$ such that $\partial_x F(x) = f(x)$. Then, following the "fundamental theorem of calculus," we can solve the integral by evaluating $F(b) - F(a)$. Another technique is Euler integration (And there are numerical techniques that improve on Euler, either by reducing the number of numerical calculations or improving the precision of the result). Still another techique is to draw on the collective memory of mathematicians of the last 350 years and look up $f(x)$ in a "table of integrals" to find an anti-derivative that you might not have been to construct on your own.

## Lengths

Imagine you have a curve on a plane. We'll look at curves that can be represented by functions of one variable, $f(x)$, so the curve is simply the graph of $f(x)$ versus $x$.

We'd like to find the length of the curve described by $f()$ over the domain $a < x < b$.

If $f()$ is linear, the answer is simple. The slope of the function is $\partial_x f(x)$ which will be a constant, call it $p$. The curve itself is the hypothenuse of a right triangle. The length of one leg is $\Delta x \equiv b-a$. The length of the other leg is $p \cdot \Delta x$. So the length of the hypothenuse is
$$s = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 p^2 + (\Delta x)^2} = \sqrt{(p^2 + 1) (\Delta x)^2} = \Delta x \sqrt{p^2 + 1}$$

Now for a slightly more complex case where the curve is not linear, as in the diagram [[source](https://www.dummies.com/education/math/calculus/how-to-calculate-arc-length-with-integration/)]:
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/segment-length.jpg")
```



You've heard the phrase, "Think globally, act locally." The spirit of differential modeling is, "model locally and let integration deal with the global stuff." The region in the little box on the left panel of the diagram represents any local area of the curve. That region is magnified in the right panel. Because **any curve looks linear over a small enough domain**, it's easy to find the length of the curve over the little segment of horizontal length $dx$ and vertical height $dy$. 

(OK, when we said, "any curve looks linear" we should have said, "any **differentiable** curve looks linear." If you're not sure where the "differentiable" comes in, think about what a non-differentiable curve might look like. Recall that "differentiable" means continuous plus a continuous first derivative.)

Of course, the vertical height of the segment of the curve is the differential, slope times height $$dy = \partial_x f(x) dx$$ Plugging this in the the expression for the *length* of the short segment gives us another differential $$ds = \sqrt{\left[\partial_x f(x)\right]^2 + 1}\, dx$$ 
The overall length of the curve (over the domain a to b) is just the sum of the many differentials of length, that is:
$$s = \int_a^b ds = \int_a^b \sqrt{\left[\partial_x f(x)\right]^2 + 1}\, dx$$

**Problem 1**: Find the length of the function $$f(x) \equiv \sqrt{1 - x^2}$$ over the domain $-1 < x < 1$. The sandbox contains the command to graph the function. You can see that the function describes the upper half of a circle of radius $r=1$.

```{r ld1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="The half circle", exercise.nlines=6, eval=FALSE}
f <- makeFun(sqrt(1 - x^2) ~ x)
slice_plot(f(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(-1, 1)), npts=500) %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
```
How long is the curve? You can answer this readily by remembering that the circumference of a full circle is $2 \pi r$. We've got half a circle here, so ...

But let's do it with integration. We'll use `antiD()` just so that you can see the logic step by step:

```{r ld2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Length of the half circle", exercise.nlines=8, eval=FALSE}
f <- makeFun(sqrt(1 - x^2) ~ x)
f <- makeFun(sin(2*pi*x/16) ~ x)
df <- D(f(x) ~ x)  # slope as a function of x
# differential of length
ds <- makeFun(sqrt(df(x)^2 + 1) ~ x)
S <- antiD(ds(x) ~ x)
S(1) - S(-1)
S(32) - S(0)
```

As an illustration of a curve length application, let's look at "The Gardens" at the University of Virginia, opened in 1824.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/3up-grounds-gardens.jpg")
```

Behind the white bench is a brick wall. It's called a "serpentine" wall because instead of being flat, it consists of alternating convex-in and convex-out sections. 

The wall was designed by Thomas Jefferson. Below is a planning document, *in Jefferson's own hand*, showing the path of the wall as seen from above. In this document, Jefferson calculates the number of bricks needed to build the serpentine wall and compares to an alternative of a flat wall with supporting pillars every 8 feet.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("www/jefferson-serpentine.jpg")
```

The serpentine wall is longer, but it doesn't require pillars for support.

How long is the serpentine wall?

First, construct a mathematical model of the shape of the wall. We'll use a sine curve: $$f(x) \equiv A \sin(2\pi x/P)$$

Each grid in the graph paper represents one foot, so we'll measure $x$ in feet.

```{r ld3, echo=FALSE, results="markdown"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "What's the period $P$ of the sine wave representing the wall?", 
  "4 feet",
  "8 feet",
  "+16 feet+",
  "32 feet",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  id = knitr::opts_current$get()$label
)
```

```{r ld4, echo=FALSE, results="markdown"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "What's the amplitude $A$ of the sine wave representing the wall?", 
  "+1 foot+",
  "2 feet",
  "3 feet",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  id = knitr::opts_current$get()$label
)
```

```{r ld5, echo=FALSE, results="markdown"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "What's the length of the serpentine wall running 32 feet in a straight line from one end to the other, as shown in the drawing? Replace the function $f()$ and the limits of integration in the previous sandbox to get your answer.", 
  "+33.2 feet+",
  "34.1 feet",
  "36.7 feet",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  id = knitr::opts_current$get()$label
)
```

## Volumes

Consider a function of two variables, like this one $g(x,y)$:

```{r }
dom <- domain(x = c(-5, 5), y = c(-5, 5))
contour_plot(g(x,y) ~ x + y, dom)
interactive_plot(g(x,y) ~ x + y, dom)
```


Suppose you think of the function as describing the surface of a circus tent and you want to know how much volume is enclosed by the tent.

We've already considered the strategy of slices in calculating the volume of objects like pyramids and spheres. Let's apply that to the volume-under-the-tent problem.

First, we'll slice up the volume into slabs that run parallel to the $y-z$ plane. Each of these slabs will be indexed according to its position on the $x$ axis. 

Second, for each slab indexed by $x$, we'll calculate the area of that slab in the $y-z$ axis. This area can be found using the earlier method of integrating. Let's take a look at a few slabs from $x=-3$ to $x=3$.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="20%", fig.show="keep"}
show_slice <- function(g, x=0) {
Pts <- tibble::tibble(
  y = seq(-5,5,length=101),
  z = g(x=x, y),
  color=ifelse(z<0, "blue", "green")
)
gf_segment(0 + z ~ y + y, data = Pts, color= ~ color, size = 2.5, alpha=.4) %>%
  gf_line(z ~ y, color="black", size=2) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "z", title=glue::glue("g({x}, y)")) %>%
    gf_refine(scale_color_identity()) %>%
    gf_lims(y=c(-8,8)) %>%
  gf_theme(theme_minimal())
}
show_slice(g, x=-3)
show_slice(g, x=-2)
show_slice(g, x=-1.75)
show_slice(g, x=-1.5)
show_slice(g, x=-1.25)
show_slice(g, x=-1)
show_slice(g, x=0)
show_slice(g, x=1)
show_slice(g, x=2)
show_slice(g, x=4)
```

Finding the area of any of these slabs is easy, just find the anti-derivative with respect to $y$ of $g(x_{slab}, y)$.
The `helper()` function in the following sandbox finds the area under the slab at location $x$. (You can ignore the rest of the function and the use of `sapply()`. All this has to do with the way the R language will handle things when you ask for more than one slab at a time.)

```{r tent, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Areas and volumes of g(x,y)", exercise.nlines=10, warning=FALSE}
slab_area <- function(x) {
  helper <- function(x) {
    F <- antiD(g(x, y) ~ y, x=x)
    F(5) - F(-5)
  }
  sapply(x, helper)
}
slab_area(x=2)
slab_area(x=4)
```
To find the total volume under the tent integrate the slab area over the extent of $x$:

```{r tent2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.cap="Areas and volumes of g(x,y)", exercise.nlines=10, warning=FALSE}
slab_area <- function(x) {
  helper <- function(x) {
    F <- antiD(g(x, y) ~ y, x=x)
    F(5) - F(-5)
  }
  sapply(x, helper)
}
slab_antid <- antiD(slab_area(x) ~ x)
slab_antid(x = 5) - slab_antid(x = -5)
```

At the heart of the computer notation is the use of `antiD()` on a function that is itself defined in terms of `antiD()`. In other words, a kind of `antiD(antiD(...))`. The math notation is prettier: $$\int_{-5}^5 \int_{-5}^5 g(x, y) dy dx$$ which can be seen as shorthand for $$\int_{-5}^5 \left\{\int_{-5}^5 g(x, y) dy\right\} dx = \int_{-5}^{5} \mbox{slab_area}(x) dx$$
The *integral within an integral* is called an "iterated integral" or, in the case here, a "double integral."

Working with double integrals (which you will see in more advanced math, science, and engineering courses) requires that you pay close attention to the "what" of the interior integrals. For instance: $$\int_{-5}^{5} g(x, y) dy$$ might appear at first glance to evaluate to a number, since it is a definite integral. But the integration $\int dy$ sums over the $y$ variable and leaves the $x$ variable alone. So $\int_{-5}^{5} g(x, y) dy$ is a function of $x$, not a number. 

```{r fv1, echo=FALSE}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "Modify the original double integral to calculate the signed volume under the tent lifted vertically by 2 meters.",
  "-141" = "Oops! You lowered the tent by 1 meter.",
  "-41" = "That's the volume before the 2 meter lift.",
  "59",
  "+159+",
  "259",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  id = knitr::opts_current$get()$label
)
```

```{r fv2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
etude2::etudeQ(
  "\"Areas\" and \"volumes\" of a function $g(x,y)$ calculated by integration are really *signed* areas and volumes. That is, where the function value is negative the local volume will be negative. What happens if you take the absolute value of the function value? Try it, calculating the volume of the of the tent lifted by 2 meters but using the absolute value of the height.",
  "235",
  "+346+",
  "457",
  "568",
  random_answer_order = FALSE,
  id = knitr::opts_current$get()$label
)
```
