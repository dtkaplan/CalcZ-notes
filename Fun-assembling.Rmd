# Assembling functions {#fun-assembling}

When we need a new function for some purpose, we practically always build it out of existing functions. For instance, a  parameterized function like $$A \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P}x\right) + C$$ is built by assempling together a straight-line input scaling, a pattern-book $\sin()$ function, and another straight-line function for scaling the output from $\sin()$.  `r mark(1300)`

In this chapter, we'll introduce three general frameworks for combining functions: linear combination, composition, and multiplication.

## Linear combination 

One of the most widely used sorts of combination is called a ***linear combination***. The mathematics of linear combination is, it happens, at the core of the use of math in applications, whether that be constructing a Google-like search engine or analyzing medical data to see if a treatment has a positive effect.

You've worked for many years with one kind of linear combination: polynomials. No doubt you've seen functions^[It's likely that you saw polynomials as things to be factored, rather than as functions taking an input and producing an output. So they were written as *equations*: $e x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0$] like $$f(x) \equiv 3 x^2 + 5 x - 2$$

There are three modeling functions in this polynomial. In this case, as in polynomials generally, they are all power-law functions: $g_0(x) \equiv 1$, $g_1(x) \equiv x$, and $g_2(x) \equiv x^2$. With these functions defined, we can write the polynomial $f(x)$ as $$f(x) \equiv 3 g_2(x) + 5 g_1(x) - 2 g_0(x)$$
Each of the functions is being scaled by a quantity---3, 5, and -2 in this example---and the scaled functions are added up. That's a linear combination; scale and add. (Later, we'll see that the ***scalars*** generally come with units. So we might well have a metric polynomial and an equivalent traditional-unit polynomial. Just wait.)


::: {.why}
Notice that we said $g_0(x) \equiv 1$ is a power-law function. Why?  Since $x^0=1$ for all $x$, we might equally well have written $g_0(x) \equiv x^0$ which is visibly a power-law function. 

We're just trying to emphasize that a polynomial is a linear combination of power-law functions, in particular those power-law functions with whole-number, positive exponents. The individual functions, say, $x^2$ or $x^5$ are called ***monomials***. A polynomial is a combination of monomials, just like a chemical polymer is a combination of monomers.
:::

There are other places where you have seen linear combinations: 

- The parameterized ***sinusoid***  $$A \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P}t\right) + C$$ is a linear combination of the functions $h_1(t) \equiv \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P} t\right)$ and $g_0(t) \equiv 1$. The scalars are $A$ and $C$.
- The parameterized ***exponential*** $$A e^{kt} + C$$ The functions being combined are $e^{kt}$ and $g_0(t) \equiv 1$. The scalars are, again, $A$ and $C$.
- The straight line function $a x + b$. The functions being combined are $x$ and $1$, the scalars are $a$ and $b$.  `r mark(1310)`

Note that neither the parameterized exponential or the parameterized sinusoid is a polynomial.

There are a few reasons for us to be introducing linear combinations here.

1. You will see linear combinations everywhere once you know to look for them.
2. There is a highly refined mathematical theory of linear combinations that gives us powerful ways to think about them as well as computer software that can quickly find the best scalars to use to match input-output data.
3. The concept of linear combination generalizes the simple idea that we have been calling "scaling the output." From now on, we'll use the linear-combination terminology and avoid the narrower idea of "scaling the output."
4. Many physical systems are described by linear combinations. For instance, the motion of a vibrating molecule or a helicopter in flight or a building shaken by an earthquake are described in terms of simple "modes" which are linearly combined to make up the entire motion. More down to Earth, the timbre of a musical instrument is set by the scalars in a linear combination of pure tones.
5. Many modeling tasks can be put into the framework of choosing an appropriate set of simple functions to combine and then (letting the computer) figure out the best scalars to use in the combination.

Even better, there is an automatic, reliable, and fast algorithm for finding the scalars for a set of functions that are to be combined to match data as closely as possible. So the modeler just has to select the functions to be used, the computer can find the coefficients. (We'll explore the mathematics and methods of linear combinations, usually called ***linear algebra***, in Block 5.)

## Function composition {#function-composition}

To ***compose*** two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, means to apply one of the functions to the output of the other. "$f()$ composed with $g()$" means $f(g(x))$. This is generally very different from "$g()$ composed with $f()$" which means $g(f(x))$.

For instance, suppose you have recorded the outdoor temperature over the course of a day and packaged this into a function $\mbox{AirTemp}(t)$: temperature as a function of time $t$. Your digital thermometer uses degrees Celsius, but you want the output units to be degrees Kelvin. The conversion function is $$\mbox{CtoK}(C) \equiv C + 273.15$$
Notice that CtoK() takes temperature as input. With this, we can write the "Kelvin as a function of time" as $$\mbox{CtoK}\left(\mbox{AirTemp}(t)\right)$$
It's important to distinguish the above time $\rightarrow$ Kelvin function from something that looks very much the same but is utterly different: $\mbox{AirTemp}\left(\mbox{CtoK}(t)\right)$. As a matter of arithmetic, you can put time as an input to CtoK(). But it has a completely different meaning in terms of the real world. If time were measured in hours, then CtoK$(t)$ would be looking at the temperature eleven and a half days ago, instead of the temperature at time $t$.

::: {.why}
We used $C$ as the name of the input to CtoK(). Shouldn't it be something like $x$ or $y$?

Keep in mind that the names of the inputs to a function can be anything whatsoever, so long as they are used consistently in the function algorithm. If we wanted, we could call the first input to any function $x$, or for that matter $y$ or giraffe.

The point of the notation $\mbox{CtoK}(C) \equiv C + 273.15$ is to make it utterly clear that $C$ is the name we're using for the input by listing it in the parentheses that follow the function name CtoK(). This, unlike high-school notation, allows us great freedom in the choice of names.  `r mark(1320)`

We can use that freedom to make it easier to communicate with other people. (And remember, one of those other people is "future you.") We used the name $C$ to reinforce the message that CtoK() converts *celsius* to *kelvin*, and not vice versa.

Here is a simple, approximate formula for the length of day (in hours) as a function of latitude $L$ and the declination angle $\delta$ of the sun. 

$$\text{day_length}(L, \delta) \equiv \frac{2}{15} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(Î´)\right)$$
The declination angle is the latitude of the point on the earth's surface pierced by an imagined line connecting the centers of the earth and the sun. On the summer solstice, it is $23.44^\circ$, the longest day of the year. 

A computer implement must look different, since $L$ and $\delta$ are typically provided in degrees while the `tan()` and other trigonometric functions in most computer languages expect units of radians. The conversion is easy: $\text{deg2rad}(d) \equiv \frac{\pi}{180} d$. The conversion the other way is $\text{rad2deg}(r) \equiv \frac{180}{\pi} r$.

In order to get the day-length formula to work in a computer, we have to compose the $\tan()$ function with `deg2rad()`. The output of `acos()` is in radians, so we have to convert it back to degrees. Like this:

```{r}
day_length <- makeFun(
  (2/15)*rad2deg(
    acos(
      -tan(deg2rad(L))*tan(deg2rad(d))
    )
  ) ~ L+d)
```

</details>

Now to make a plot of day length as a function of day of the year. Of course, `day_length(L, d)` does not take day of the year into account. What's missing is to know the declination of the sun as a function of calendar day.

We'll represent calendar day as a number $n$ that runs from 0 at the start of January 1st to 365 at the end of December 31. Given this convention, the declination of the sun is
```{r}
delta_sun <- makeFun(-23.44*cos((2*pi/365)*(n+10) ) ~ n)
```

Composing `day_length()` with `delta_sun()` (on the `d` argument only) we get a function of day of year `n`:
```{r}
slice_plot(
  day_length(39, delta_sun(n)) ~ n, 
  domain(n=c(0,365))
  )

Income inequality is a matter of perennial political debate. In the US, most people support Social Security, which is an income re-distribution programming dating back almost a century. But other re-distribution policies are controversial. Some believe they are essential to a healthy society, others that the "cure" is worse than the "disease."  `r mark(1330)`

Whatever one's views, it's helpful to have a way to quantify inequality. There are many ways that this might be done. A mathematically sophisticated one is called the ***Gini coefficient***.

Imagine that society was divided statistically into income groups, from poorest to richest. Each of these income groups consists of a fraction of the population and has, in aggregate, a fraction of the national income. Poor people tend to be many in number but to have a very small fraction of income. Wealthy people are few in number, but have a large fraction of income. The table shows data for US households in 2009:^[These data, as well as the general idea for the topic come from La Haye and Zizler (2021), "The Lorenz Curve in the Classroom", *The American Statistician*, 75(2):217-225]

group label  | population | aggregate income | cumulative income | cumulative pop.
:------------|-----------:|-----------------:|:-------
poorest      | 20%   | 3.4%  | 3.4%         | 20%
low-middle   | 20%   | 8.6%  | 12.0%        | 40%
middle       | 20%   | 14.6% | 26.6%        | 60%
high-middle  | 20%   | 23.2% | 47.8%        | 80%
richest      | 20%   | 50.2% | 100.0%       | 100%


The ***cumulative*** income shows the fraction of income of all the people in that group or poorer.  Similarly for the cumulative population.

A function that relates the cumulative population to the cumulative income is called a "Lorenz" function. The data are graphed in Figure \@ref(fig:lorenz-data) and a function has been fitted to the data.

```{r lorenz, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Data on household incomes in the US in 2009."}
Income <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ income, ~ pop,
  0,     0,
  3.4,  20,
  12.0, 40, 
  26.6, 60,
  47.8, 80,
  100, 100
) %>%
  mutate(income=income/100, pop=pop/100)
P <- gf_point(income ~ pop, data = Income) %>%
  gf_labs(x="Population percentile (p)", y="Cumulative income percentile (L)") %>%
  gf_refine(coord_fixed())
P
```
Lorenz curves are necessarily concave up, which amounts to saying that the curve gets steeper and steeper as the population percentile increases. (Why? Because at any point, poorer people are to the left and richer to the right.) And it must connect (0,0) to (1, 1). 

Calling the income percentile $L$ a function of the population percentile $p$, a Lorenz function is $L(p)$ that satisfies the requirements in the previous paragraph.
Here are some functions that meet the requirements:

- $L_b(p) \equiv p^b$ where $1 \leq b$.
- $L_q(p) \equiv 1 - (1-p)^q$ where $0 < q \leq 1$

Notice that each of these functions has just one parameter. It seems implausible that the workings of a complex society can be summarized with just one number. We can use the curve-polishing techniques introduced in Section \@ref(modeling-cycle) to find the "best" parameter value to match the data. Then we can see if "best" is good enough.  `r mark(1340)`

```{r}
Lb <- fitModel(income ~ pop^b, data = Income, start=list(b=1.5))
Lq <- fitModel(income ~ 1 - (1-pop)^q, data = Income, start=list(q=0.5))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:lorenz-1-fun) compares the polished functions to the data.
```{r lorenz-1-fun, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Lorenz curves $L_b(p)$ (blue) and $L_q(p)$ (red) fitted to the household income data."}
P %>%
  slice_plot(Lb(pop) ~ pop, color="blue", npts=500) %>%
  slice_plot(Lq(pop) ~ pop, color="red", npts=500) %>%
  slice_plot(.55*Lb(pop) + .45*Lq(pop) ~ pop, color="white")
```
Neither form $L_b(p)$ or $L_q(p)$ gives a compelling description of the data. What to do.

We can provide more parameters by constructing more complicated Lorenz functions. Here are two ways to build a new Lorenz function out of an existing one:

- The product of any two Lorenz functions, $L_1(p) L_2(p)$ is itself a Lorenz function.
- A linear combination of any two Lorenz functions, $a L_1(p) + (1-a) L_2(p)$, so long as the scalars add up to 1, is itself a Lorenz function. For instance, the white curve in Figure \@ref(fig:lorenz-1-fun) is the linear combination of 0.45 times the red curve plus 0.55 times the blue curve.

Question: Is the composition of two Lorenz functions a Lorenz function? 

To get started, figure out whether or not $L_1(L_2(0)) = 0$ and $L_1(L_2(1)) = 1$. If the answer is yes, then we need to find a way to compute the concavity of a Lorenz function to determine if the composition will always be concave up. We'll need additional tools for this.

## The modeling polynomial {#modeling-polynomial-1}

Sometimes, in order to model some simple relationship you need to build a function whose graph has a simple, curving shape.  `r mark(1350)`

A simple but surprisingly powerful approach is to use a ***low-order polynomial***. The ***order of a polynomial*** is the highest exponent on the input. For example, a straight-line function, $g_1(x) \equiv a_0 + a_1 x$, is a **first-order** polynomial. A ***quadratic***, $g_2(x) \equiv b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2$ is a **second-order** polynomial.

Many modelers are tempted to extend the technique to third-, fourth-, fifth-order and even higher. This is only rarely worthwhile since all second-, fourth-, sixth- and higher-even-order ***monomials*** have basically the same U-shape, like a referee signalling a touch-down. Similarly, first-, third-, fifth- and higher odd-order monomial have  similar ![](www/cubic.png) shapes.  

An ofttimes better approach is to compose the polynomial with a curved but monotonic function, such as a logarithm.

## Function multiplication

The third in our repertoire of methods for making new function out of old is plain old multiplication. With two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, the product is simply $f(x)g(x)$.

It's essential to distinguish between function multiplication and function composition:

$$\underbrace{f(x) g(x)}_\mbox{multiplication}\ \ \ \ \underbrace{f(g(x)) \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \ g(f(x))}_\mbox{composition}$$

In function composition, only one of the functions---the ***interior function*** is applied to the overall input, $x$ in the above example. The other function gets its input from the output of its partner. 

In multiplication, each of the functions is applied to the input individually. Then their outputs are multiplied to produce the overall output.

In function composition, the order of the functions matters: $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ are in general completely different functions.

In function multiplication, the order doesn't matter because multiplication is ***commutative***, that is, if $a$ and $b$ are each quantities, $a \times b = b \times a$.  `r mark(1360)`



***Transient vibration***

A guitar string is plucked to produce a note. The note is, of course, vibrations of the air created by vibrations of the string. 

After plucking, the note fades away. An important model of this is a sinusoid (of the correct period to correspond to the frequency of the note) times an exponential.

Function multiplication is used so often in modeling that you'll see it in many modeling situations. Here's one example that is important in physics and communication: the ***wave packet***. Overall, the wave packet is a localized oscillation as in Figure \@ref{fig:wave-packet}. 

```{r wave-packet, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A *wave packet* constructed by multiplying a sinusoid by a hump function."}
wave_packet <- function(x, A=1, center = 0, width = 5, P=1, phase = 0) {
  A*sin(2*pi*x/P)*dnorm((x - center)/width)
}
slice_plot(wave_packet(x, A=2, center=3, width  = 4, P  = 10/5 ) ~ x, 
           domain(x = c(-15, 15)), npts = 500)
```
This is the product of two simple functions: a hump times a sinusoid.

```{r making-wave-packet, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show="hold", fig.cap="The two components of the wave packet in Figure \\@ref(fig:wave-packet)"}
sinusoid <- makeFun(sin(2*pi*x/P) ~ x, P=10/5)
envelope <- makeFun(2*dnorm((x - center)/width) ~ x, center=3, width=4)
slice_plot(envelope(x) ~ x, domain(x = c(-15, 15)), color="blue") %>%
  gf_labs(title="The \"envelope\" of the wave packet")
slice_plot(sinusoid(x) ~ x, domain(x = c(-15, 15)),
           color="red", npts=500) %>%
  gf_labs(title="The oscillation in the wave packet. ")
```
EXERCISES: Say which two kinds of functions are being multiplied here.

```{r echo=FALSE}
slice_plot(sin(2*pi*t/2.1)*sin(2*pi*t/20) ~ t, domain(t=c(-30, 40)), npts=500)
```
```{r sine-in-sine1, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}

  "What are the two basic modeling functions being multiplied?",
  "+A sinusoid and another sinusoid with a faster period.+",
  "A hump and a sinusoid.",
  "A sigmoidal function and a sinusoid.",
  ""
)
```


```{r sine-in-sine2, echo=FALSE, results="markup"}
etude2::etudeQ(
"What is the period of the envelope?", 
"10" = "It's true that the broad peaks in the overall function occur every 10 time units. But a sine wave has two excursions from zero every cycle, one positive and one negative.

"+20+",
"30" = "If this were so, the dips in amplitude of the faster sign would occur every 15 time units.",
random_answer_order = FALSE
)
```

EXERCISE: Provide a sigmoid and a series of humps. Ask the student to sketch out the product.

## All together now!

Two or all three of the techniques for combining functions---linear combinations, function composition, and function multiplication---can be used in the same function.  `r mark(1370)`

Consider the function for the length of the day
$$\text{day_length}(L, \delta) \equiv \frac{2}{15} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(Î´)\right)$$
The 2/15 is scaling the output of $\arccos()$. The $\arcos()$ is being composed with an interior function that is itself a scaled product of two functions.
