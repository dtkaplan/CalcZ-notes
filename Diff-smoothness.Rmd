Now that you have a concept of the derivative of a function, we can discuss some of the terms that are used to describe functions in general.

## Piecewise functions

Our foil for showing smoothness and continuity.

## Continuity

Lift the pen. 



## Differentiability

We want the derivative to exist no matter the details of how we define the derivative.

1.  $\partial_x f(x) \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$
2.  $\partial_x f(x) \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}$
3.  $\partial_x f(x) \equiv \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2 h}$
