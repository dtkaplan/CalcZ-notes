<p>Calculus is the set of concepts and techniques that provide the main mathematical basis for dealing with motion, growth, decay, and oscillation. The phenomena can be as simple as a ball arcing through the air to as complex as the airflow over a wing that generates lift. Calculus is used in biology and business, chemistry, physics and engineering. It is the basis for weather prediction, understanding climate change, the algorithms for heart rate and blood oxygen measurement by wristwatches. It is a major part of the language of science, of logistics. The electron orbitals of chemistry, the stresses of bones and beams, and the business cycle of recession and rebound are all understood primarily through calculus.</p>
<p>Calculus has been central to science from the very beginnings. It is no coincidence that the scientific method was introduced and the language of calculus was invented by the same small group of people during the historical period known as the enlightenment. Learning calculus has always been a badge of honor and an entry ticket to professions. Millions of students career ambitions have been enhanced by passing a calculus course or thwarted by lack of access to one.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, a hit musical featured a man who was “the very model of a modern major general.” One of his claims for modernity was that “I’m very good at integral and differential calculus.”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="link%20to%20video"&gt;Watch here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, what was modern in 1880 is not modern anymore. Yet, amazingly, calculus today is every bit as central to science and technology as it ever was, and is much more important to logistics, economics and myriad other fields than every before.
In the last 20 years, calculus has become even more important. There’s a very concrete reason for this. Science, engineering, and society have now fully adopted the computer for almost all aspects of work, study, and life. The amount of data collected and used has exploded. Machine learning has become the way human decision makers interact with such data.</p>
<p>Think about what it means to become “computerized.” To take an everyday example, consider video. Over the span of a human life we moved from a system which involved people going to theaters to watch the shadows recorded on cellulose film to the distribution by low-resolution television, to the introduction of high-def broadcast video, to on demand streaming from huge libraries of movies. Just about anyone can record, edit, and distribute their own video. The range of topics (including calculus) on which you can access a video tutorial or demonstration is incredibly vast. All of this recent progress is owed to computers.</p>
<p>The “stuff” that computers operate on, transform and transmit is always mathematical representations stored as bits. The creation of mathematical representations of objects and events in the real world is essential to every task of any sort that any computer performs. Calculus is a key component of inventing and using such representations.</p>
<p>You may be scratching your head. If calculus is so important, why is it that many of your friends who took calculus came away wondering what it is for? What’s so important about “slopes” and “areas” and how come your high-school teacher couldn’t tell you what calculus is for?</p>
<p>The disconnect between the enthusiasm expressed in the preceding paragraphs and the lived experience of students is very real. There are two major reasons for that disconnect, both of which we handle head on in this book.</p>
<p>First, teachers of mathematics have a deep respect for tradition. Such respect has its merits but the result is that almost all calculus is taught using methods that were appropriate for the era of paper and pencil, but not for the computer era. As you will see, in this book we express the concepts of calculus in a way that carries directly over to the uses of calculus on computers and in genuine work.</p>
<p>Second, the uses of calculus are enabled not by the topics of Calc I and Calc II, but the courses for which I/II are a preliminary: linear algebra and dynamics. Only a small fraction of students who start in Calc I ever reach the parts of calculus that are the most useful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a huge amount of bloat in the topics of Calc I/II which can be removed to make room for the genuinely important topics. What’s more, fully embracing modern computing in teaching and using calculus means that we can discard the gratuitous use of algebra</p>
