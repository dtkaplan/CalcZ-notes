<p>Calculus is about change, and change is about relationships. A changing climate is about the relationship between, say, global average temperature and time. It’s also about changing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and methane, both their production and elimination by atmospheric and geological processes. It’s about how burning oil (a change in configuration of the atoms in hydrocarbons) contributes to ocean acidification (the process of change in ocean pH). It’s about a whole complex and intricate network of relationships and how change in one component provokes change in others.</p>
<p>This book presents calculus in terms of two simple but central concepts: <strong><em>functions</em></strong> and <strong><em>quantities</em></strong>. Those words have everyday meanings which are, happily, close to the specific mathematical concepts that we will be using over and over again. Close … but not identical. So pay careful attention to the brief descriptions that follow.</p>
<div id="quantity-vs-number" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Quantity vs number<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quantity-vs-number"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A mathematical <strong><em>quantity</em></strong> is an amount of “stuff.” The real-world stuff might be mass or time or length. It equally well can be velocity or volume or momentum or corn yield per acre. We live in a world of stuff, some of which is tangible (e.g., corn, mass, force) and some of which is harder to get your hands on and your minds around (acceleration, crop yield, fuel economy). An important use of calculus is helping us conceptualize the abstract kinds of stuff as mathematical compositions of simpler stuff. For example, crop yield incorporates mass with length and time. Later, you’ll see us using the more scientific-sounding term <strong><em>dimension</em></strong> instead of “stuff.” In fact, Chapter <a href="dimensions.html#dimensions">15</a> is entirely dedicated to the topic of dimensions, but for now it’s sufficient for you to understand that numbers alone are not quantities.</p>
<p>Most people are inclined to think “quantity” is the same as “number”; they conflate the two. This is understandable but misguided. By itself a number is meaningless. What meaning does the number 5 have without more context? Quantity, on the other hand, combines a number with the appropriate context to describe some amount of stuff. So, the first thing you need to know about any quantity is the kind of stuff it describes. A “mile” is a kind of stuff: length. A meter is the same kind of stuff: length. A liter is a different kind of stuff: volume. A gallon and an acre-foot are the same kind of stuff: volume.</p>
<p>“Stuff,” as we mean it here, is what we measure. As you know, we measure with <strong><em>units</em></strong>. Which units are appropriate depends on the kind of stuff. Meters, miles, microns are all appropriate units of length, even though the actual lengths of these units differ markedly. (A mile is roughly a million microns.)</p>
<p>Only after you know the dimension and units does the number have meaning. Thus, a <em>number</em> is only part of specifying a <em>quantity</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s the salient difference between number and quantity when it comes to calculus: All sorts of arithmetic and other mathematical operations can be performed to combine numbers: addition, multiplication, square roots, etc. When performing mathematics on quantities, only multiplication and division are universally allowed. For addition and subtraction, square roots, and such, the operation makes sense only if the dimensions are suitable.</p>
<p>The mathematics of units and dimension are the equivalent in the technical world of common sense in our everyday world. For instance (and this may not make sense at this point), if someone tells me they are taking the square root of 10 liters, I know immediately that either they are just mistaken or that they haven’t told me essential elements of the situation. It’s just as if someone said, “I swam across the tennis court.” You know that they either used the wrong verb—walk and run would work—or that it wasn’t a tennis court, or that something important was unstated, perhaps, “During the flood, I swam across the tennis court.”</p>

<div id="functions" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#functions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The other central concept in the book is <strong><em>functions</em></strong> in their mathematical and computing sense; this is the primary topic for Block 1. A function is something that takes one or more inputs and returns an output. In calculus, we’ll deal mainly with functions that take one or more quantities as inputs and return another quantity as output. But sometimes we’ll work with functions that take functions as input and return a quantity as output. And there will even be functions that take a function as inputs and return a function as an output.</p>
<p>You’ve almost certainly seen functions expressed in the general form <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. The function is <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>, the input is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Perhaps it’s obvious at this point that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a quantity. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the operation performed on that quantity. In computing, there are definite, widely used, notations to identify the output of a function. Strangely, in high-school mathematics there is not. This is a major source of confusion both to students learning calculus and professionals using computers to do the work of calculus.</p>
<p>It’s possible to present calculus without functions. For instance, Isaac Newton, the inventor of calculus, spoke of “flowing quantities.”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;In Newton’s language, a “flowing quantity” was a &lt;em&gt;fluent&lt;/em&gt; and the change in a flowing quantity was a &lt;em&gt;fluxion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It’s practically impossible (and generally unwise) to do computing without functions. They are a basic building block of every mainstream modern computer language. Since the operations of calculus in actual practice are performed on the computer, common sense suggests that we should describe calculus in terms of functions. That’s what we will do in this book.</p>
<p>For you, this may take a bit of getting used to. The reason is that the notation used in high-school algebra and in almost all calculus texts is not the notation of functions. For example, almost all students have seen a mathematical <strong><em>expression</em></strong> in this form: <span class="math display">\[y = m x + b\]</span>
Using the language of math classes, we can say that the expression “describes a relationship between two variables.” And from your experience, you know that the <strong><em>variables</em></strong> are <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The other letters, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, are something else. Many students will reflexively call them the “slope” and “intercept” of the “line.”</p>
<p>You are so used to this that you probably don’t see the huge ambiguity involved. For instance, what is a variable? Common sense suggest that it’s a thing that varies. But if we know the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, is it still a variable? In statistics, a variable is something else entirely: a trait. Since statistics and mathematics are used together, this is bound to bring confusion.</p>
<p>Or consider famous famous sentence in high-school mathematics:
<span class="math display">\[y = m x + b\]</span></p>
<p>The notation of equations is a poor substitute for the notation of functions. For instance, what is the input and what is the output? It’s not explicitly stated. If, using the allowed manipulations of algebra, we re-arrange <span class="math display">\[y = m x + b \ \ \text{into}\ \ \ m = \frac{y-b}{x}\]</span> do we still have a function? If so, is it the same function as <span class="math inline">\(m x + b\)</span>? Would <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the input or would both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> be inputs? How about <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>? And in the re-arrangement, we have a problem if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is zero, a problem we would never encounter in the original <span class="math inline">\(y=mx+b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The engineers and mathematicians who invented computer languages realized that they had to be explicit in identifying the input, the output, and the function itself; computers demand unambiguous instructions.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s common to give computers ambiguous instructions. The computer will carry out the instruction in the way it does, which may not be anything like what the programmer expected or intended.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> Sorting this out was a difficult process even for those mathematically talented and skilled pioneers of notation. So, you can be forgiven for the occasional confusion you have when dealing with notation that pre-dates computing.</p>
<p>In this book we’ll be explicit and consistent in the ways we denote functions so that you can always figure out what are the inputs and how they are being translated into the output. A good start in learning to read the function notation is to see the equivalent of <span class="math inline">\(y=m x + b\)</span> in that notation: <span class="math display">\[g(x) \equiv m x + b\]</span>
Notice that we’re using <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> (with three parallel bars) rather than <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>. And there’s no <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> appears in parentheses on the left side of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> to say explicitly “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> stands for the input.” The notation provides a place to state the <strong><em>name</em></strong> of the function, in this case <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>, so that we can refer to the function unambiguously when we are doing operations on it. Since often we’ll be using many functions at the same time, it’s helpful to have a way to distinguish them by name. The functional notation makes it easy to create many different names: not just <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(g_\star()\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h_\text{altitude}()\)</span>, azimuth(), and so on. Try that with <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></p>
