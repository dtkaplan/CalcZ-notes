<li>
<strong>[Deriv-2b]</strong> <em>Understand how calculating the slope (using a small value of h) of a function reflects the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point.</em>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You have known how to calculate an average rate of change for a long time. But possibly you don’t yet fully know what the <strong>use</strong> of such a calculation is other than to help you pass a math test. In this section, we’re going to show how to calculate the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> function and show some of the many things this is useful for.</p>
<p>To orient you to what’s going to happen …</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We’re going to set up the familiar average-rate-of-change calculation in a new framework.</li>
<li>Using that framework, you’ll be able to calculate an average-rate-of-change <em>function</em>.</li>
<li>Then, by turning a knob on the calculation in (2), you’ll be able to calculate the <strong><em>instantaneous</em></strong> rate of change function. By the way, the knob is called <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, this section will introduce you to the operation called <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-h-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> The <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> framework<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-h-framework"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Calculating an average rate of change involved specifying an interval of the function domain: the left side <span class="math inline">\(t_A\)</span> and the right side <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span>. Let’s change this notation a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left endpoint of domain: <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>
</li>
<li>Right endpoint of domain: <span class="math inline">\(t_0 + h\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is nothing fundamentally new here. The interval is still specified by two numbers, but now they are called <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. The width of the interval is just <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, which is a little easier to write than <span class="math inline">\(t_B - t_A\)</span>, but is still just the width.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>average rate of change</em></strong> in the new notation is <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(t_0 + h) - f(t_0)}{h}\ \ \mbox{rather than}\ \ \frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}\]</span></p>
<div class="todo">
<p>Write an app showing a function, the derivative of the function at a given point, and a finite-difference with <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> defined by dragging the mouse. Click on a point and enter that point in a plot of the derivative. Checkbox to show whole derivative function.</p>
</div>
<div class="why" latex-data="">
<p>Why are you using <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>?</p>
<p>Remember, the <em>name</em> of an input can be anything at all so long as you use it consistently on the left side of <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> and on the right side. All of these are the same definition:
<span class="math display">\[g(t) \equiv e^{kt},\ \ g(x) \equiv e^{kx},\ \ g(y) \equiv e^{ky},\ \ g(\mbox{altitude}) \equiv e^{k\,{\small{\text{altitude}}}}\]</span>
When we work with functions of two or more variables, it will be essential to give easily distinguished names to the inputs. We’re trying to get you in the habit of paying attention to the names of inputs and break a <em>bad habit</em> from high-school math of calling the input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the output <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we are going to make a small, subtle, and important change. Instead of thinking of the average rate of change <em>at a specific interval</em> <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_0 + h\)</span>, we’re going to write an average-rate-of-change <strong><em>function</em></strong>. And since we’re in the habit of giving <em>names</em> to functions, we’ll be careful to name average-rate-of-change functions in a way that makes explicit the connection to the function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> whose rate of change is being calculated.</p>
<p>Our convention will be to use two additional components in the names of average-rate-of-change functions. The first component is to lead with a “D” in a caligraphic font: <span class="math inline">\(\cal D\)</span>. The second component will be the name of the input whose interval is being used in calculating the rate of change. So …</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_t\, f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}\]</span>
You can pronounce <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\)</span> as “difference with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.” But remember that the function name is the whole deal, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\, f()\)</span>, which is to be read as “difference with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>.” Admittedly a long name. Don’t be surprised later when we start using <em>nicknames</em> like Liz (for Elizabeth) or Bill (for William). For instance, later we’ll save ink and breath by using the nickname <span class="math inline">\(\dot{f}()\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\, f()\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the way we’ve defined <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t f(t)\)</span>, it’s reasonable to assume that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a <strong><em>parameter</em></strong>: a symbol naming a numerical value that has to be specified before <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\, f(t)\)</span> can be evaluated at a specific <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Find a formula for <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_x\, g(t)\)</span>the average-rate-of-change function with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv x^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) = \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} = 2 x + h\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>I like to think of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> as a kind of <em>tire iron</em>, a small tool used to stretch the bead of a bicycle tire in order to pull it over the wheel rim.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-53"></span>
<img src="www/tire-iron.png" alt="A tire iron in use" width="30%"><p class="caption">
Figure 9.1: A tire iron in use
</p>
</div>
<p>Once the tire iron has done its job, it’s removed and you would never know that it was ever there (except that the tire is now successfully mounted on the wheel).</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Find an average-rate-of-change function with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(g(x) \equiv x^2\)</span>, but remove the tire iron <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> when you’re done.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) 
= \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{stretch $x$ a bit}\\
= \frac{x^2 + 2 x h + h^2 - x^2}{h}\ \ \mbox{pull over rim}\\
= \frac{2 x h + h^2}{h} \ \ \mbox{still pulling ...}\\
= 2 x + h \ \ \mbox{success!}\]</span></p>
<p>Now remove the tire iron to get <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) = 2x\]</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>But this is calculus, not bicycle mechanics. How do we know that removing the tire iron isn’t damaging the mathematical wheel? Historically, this has been a serious debate, resolved only with great difficulty more than a century after calculus started being used successfully.</p>
<p>Still in the spirit of having fun, let’s try a more serious metaphor… imagining <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is actually a central character in a calculus play. The character <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is in the middle of the story but <em>never appears in the play</em>, like the missing character Godot in the famous play <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot#Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></em>.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>We said that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in the finite rate of change function <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_x g()\)</span>, so long as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is small, plays both a central role and has hardly any effect. An economizing director re-writes the play to take <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> out of it, setting <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span>: a non-speaking, offstage role.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen using legitimate algebra that <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) = 2 x + h\]</span> Re-writing by replacing <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> with 0 streamlines the play, turning <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g()\)</span> from a dialog involving both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> into a monologue with <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> absent: <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) = 2 x\]</span> Simple.</p>
<p>And yet … the director gets a letter from the Bit Players Union.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We observe that you have eliminated the role of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in the final production version of <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_x g(x)\)</span>. This is a violation of Union regulations. Recall that the rate-of-change function <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_x g(x)\)</span> is defined as a ratio: <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x g(x) \equiv \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}\]</span> Although the name <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> does not need to appear in the argument list of <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_x g(x)\)</span>, eliminating <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> entirely by replacing her with zero is a <strong>division by zero error</strong> forbidden by Article 3.16§B¶2 of the Unified Laws of Arithmetic. We ask that you comply with this Article by re-instating the role of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> in all evaluations of <span class="math inline">\({\cal D} g(x)\)</span>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this, the director calls her lawyer. Is there a loophole for removing <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> without breaking the mathematical prohibition on dividing by zero?</p>

</h2>
<p>Let’s put aside for the moment the issue of the disappearing <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<div class="forinstructor" latex-data="">
<p>Historically, such “putting aside” has incurred a great deal of criticism. In 1734, famous philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley">George Berkeley</a> (1685-1753) published a long-titled book: <em>The Analyst: A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician: Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and Inferences of the Modern Analysis Are More Distinctly Conceived, or More Evidently Deduced, Than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith</em>. In <em>The Analyst</em>, Berkeley took issue with the arguments of that time that it is legitimate to divide by <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> when, ultimately, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> will be replaced by zero. Calling <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> an “evanescent increment,” he asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“And what are these same evanescent Increments? They are neither finite Quantities nor Quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, Berkeley believed that the ghost of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> yielded correct results. His objection was that the framers of calculus had made two, canceling errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“[B]y virtue of a two fold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet truth.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Berkeley was saying that calculus had not yet been put on a solid logical foundation. It was to be more than a century after Berkeley’s death until this work was accomplished. Once accomplished, the results that had been claimed true all along were confirmed.</p>
<p>I propose that we start with the results, which is what everyone <em>uses</em>. Later, we can introduce the new concepts on which the new logic was based. The names of the concepts—continuity, smoothness, singularity—are widely and effectively used in talking about functions, but the names, like many words in English, can be put to good and accurate use without memorizing the precise definitions.</p>
</div>

</h2>
<p>First and foremost, remember that a derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span> is a <strong><em>function</em></strong>. The process of constructing the derivative from the original function is called <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong> as in "differentiate <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in order to produce the function <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Just as we have words to describe classes of functions—exponential, sinusoid, power-law, sigmoid—we have a word to refer to a function created by differentiation. That word, <strong><em>derivative</em></strong>, comes from a more general word, “derive,” which means to obtain something from a source.</p>
<p>The use of the word “derivative” in mathematics to refer to a particular sort of derivation is at once clever and incredibly confusing. Insofar as calculus textbooks feature extensive drill on deriving the formula for a differentiated function, “derivative” is natural. And perhaps the connection is reinforced by a similarity in sound: “deriv” is like “differ” turned inside out. “Deriv” has the f-sound at the end and the r-sound in the middle, “differ” has it the other way round.</p>
<p>Unfortunate, the calculus text drill on the algebraic properties used in derivations creates an entirely misleading impression. Students routinely draw the conclusion that a derivative is <em>made</em> or <em>constructed</em> or <em>derived</em> from another function. That may be true in textbooks, but it’s more broadly true that <strong>every function is a derivative</strong>. There’s no genuine need, except in textbook exercises, to insist that “derivative” is anything other than a synonym for “function.”</p>
<p>Rather than setting a narrow focus on the algebraic and numerical processes for differentiation, you should look at the big picture: there are functions galore and some of those functions are related to each other in a specific way that turns out, in the development of science and mathematics, to be especially important for describing real-world relationships.</p>
<p>A nice, everyday framework to summarize the sorts of relationship involved in differentiation is the relationship between parent and child. Imagine that every person corresponds to a particular function. A mother and father pair is two almost identical functions, functions that differ by a constant. Their child is the derivative of those functions—both of them.</p>
<p>Children have parents, parents have parents, everybody has parents. The parent/child relationship connects two generations, but there are also grandparent/child relationships, great-grandparent/child relationships and so on. Similarly there is a relationship between a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and its derivative <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span>, and between a function and the “derivative of the derivative” which we write <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{xx} f(x)\)</span> and call a “second derivative.” There are third derivatives (great-grandchildren), fourth derivatives (great-great-grandchildren) and so on down the line.</p>
<p>Every child is a person, every parent is a person, every grandparent is a person. Similarly, every function is a function, every derivative is a function. Since a derivative is a function, it can also have a derivative.</p>
<p>There are important and instructive ways that derivative relationships between mathematical functions differ from the relationships within biological families. For instance, a function can be its own derivative. Any parent function has only one child function; there are not two different functions that are children of the same parent. And child functions have many parent functions that look astoundingly alike. They differ only by a constant, such as <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + 5\)</span>, which have the same child (which, as you will see, is <span class="math inline">\(2 x\)</span>).</p>
<p>Many a drama involves a parent looking for a lost child. Functions are in the happy situation that finding a child is a matter of turning a crank and is easily automated. Proving that a person is the child of another is nowadays done with genetic testing. For functions it’s much more straightforward: turn the crank and if you get that person as a result, you’ve established the relationship.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, just as there is a mathematical process for finding the child of a function, there is another process for finding a parent of a function. Finding the child from the parent is <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>; finding a parent from the child is <strong><em>anti-differentiation</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Calculus is important and useful because many processes and properties of real-world objects and situations are related to one another in the same parent-child manner as functions and their derivatives and anti-derivatives. The metaphysics of why this is the case is a matter of speculation. Perhaps “calculus” is like evolution: the techniques we call calculus reflect the “survival of the fittest” for constructing models of the real world.</p>
<p>To explore the …/parent/child/grandchild/… relationship for functions, you need a technology for finding the child of any parent. There are several technologies for turning the crank that lets us find a parent’s child … that is, the derivative of a function. For now, we’ll give you just one such technology that lets a computer turn the crank.</p>
<p>In R/mosaic, differentiation can be accomplished using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> function. Give a tilde expression as the argument in the same manner as you do for <code>slice_plot()</code> or <code>contour_plot()</code>. To illustrate: Suppose you have a function <code>f(x)</code>. The derivative of that function can be located and given a name for later use by a simple R command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">dx_f</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">f</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>~ x</code> can be pronounced “with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.”</p>
<p>We’re using the name <code>dx_f</code> in this example to remind you of the mathematical notation <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f(x)\)</span>. But, as always, you could use any name you like for the output of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> and use whatever name is appropriate in the tilde expression. For instance, if you are modeling Greek mythology<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;A mathematical function has only one derivative. Greek gods had many children. That’s why it’s mythology and not mathology.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a>, you might encounter</p>

<p>Like the leagues of Marvel superheroes in comics and movies, the Basic Modeling Functions (BMF) are an assembled collection. In the back story of how the BMFs came together, you’ll read that the derivative of each of the BMFs is itself a BMF. This is no accident.</p>
<p>Back in the days of ancient Greece and before, the mysteries of the World were attributed to gods and their children. Gods had many children because there were many connections among phenomena, for instance, rain, wind, and thunder are all different things but closely related.</p>
<p>Science generally describes relationships between different things in the natural world—position, velocity, acceleration, force, energy—using derivatives and anti-derivatives. The BMFs are the superheroes of calculus because they exemplify the relationships that drive the process of the world, just as did the mythological gods and their mythological children.</p>
<p>Which BMF is the ~<del>child</del>~ derivative of the exponential function?</p>
<p>We can turn the crank with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>child_of_exp()</code> looks very much like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">exp()</a></code> itself. On semi-log axes, <code>child_of_exp()</code> the graph is a straight line confirming the relationship.

<p>"The map, published in 2011 by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography, covered 4,440 square miles in the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas. It was made as part of the institute’s mission to create accurate maps to be used by businesses and researchers.</p>
<p>“Dr. Inomata learned about the map from Rodrigo Liendo, an archaeologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The resolution of the map was low. But the outlines of countless archaeological sites stood out to Dr. Inomata. So far, he has used it to identify the ruins of 27 previously unknown Maya ceremonial centers that contain a type of construction that archaeologists had never seen before. These sites may hold insights into the origins of Maya civilization.”</p>
