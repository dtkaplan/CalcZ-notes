</h1>
<p>Seen very abstractly, a mathematical model, as we are using the term, is a set of <strong><em>functions</em></strong> that represent the relationships between inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>At the most simple level, building a model can be a short process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Develop an understanding of the relationship you want to model. Often, part of this “understanding” is the pattern seen in data.</li>
<li>Choose a function type—e.g. exponential, sinusoidal, sigmoid—that you think would be a good match to the relationship.</li>
<li>Find parameters that scales your function to be able to accept real-world inputs and generate real-world outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to distinguish between two basic types of model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong><em>Empirical models</em></strong> which are rooted in <strong><em>observation</em></strong> and <strong><em>data</em></strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Mechanistic models</em></strong> such as those created by applying fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to put off mechanistic models for a while, for two reasons. First, the “fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such” are often expressed with the concepts and methods of calculus. We are heading there, but at this point you don’t yet know the core concepts and methods of calculus. Second, most students don’t make a careful study of the “fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such” until <em>after</em> they have studied calculus. So examples of mechanistic models will be a bit hollow at this point.</p>
<p>The process of constructing a model that is a good match for data is called <strong><em>curve fitting</em></strong>, or, more generally, <strong><em>fitting a model</em></strong>.</p>
<div id="variations-from-scaling" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Variations from scaling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variations-from-scaling"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A good place to start building a model is to pick one of the basic modeling functions. This works surprisingly often. To remind you, here are our seven basic modeling functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>straight-line</li>
<li>exponential</li>
<li>power-law</li>
<li>logarithm</li>
<li>sinusoid</li>
<li>hump</li>
<li>sigmoid</li>
</ul>
<p>It helps in making the selection to have ready to mind the basic shape of each of these function families. To review, revisit Section <a href="graphs-and-graphics.html#function-shapes">5.3</a>.</p>
<p>Remember also that, in general, we scale the inputs and scale the output. This means that in choose a model family, we don’t have to worry at first about the numbers on the axes. (Of course, those numbers will be critically important later on in the process!) The scaling does, however, allow us to consider some variations on the shapes of the modeling functions. In particular, the <strong><em>input scaling</em></strong> lets us flip the shape right-for-left. And the <strong><em>output scaling</em></strong> lets us flip the shape top-for-bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, basic shape</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(f(-t)\)</span>, flipped right-for-left</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(-f(t)\)</span>, flipped top-for-bottom</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(-f(-t)\)</span>, flipped both top-for-bottom and right-for-left</li>
</ul>
<p>For functions such as the sinusoid, flipping is not much use, since the flipped sinusoid curve is still a sinusoid. Similarly, a right-for-left flipped hump function has the same shape as the original. For the straight-line function, flipping of either sort accomplishes the same thing: changing the sign of the slope.</p>
<p>For the exponential function, the two possible types of flipping—right-for-left and top-for-bottom—produce four different curves, all of which are exponential, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:four-variations"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

Figure 7.5: Stan’s data
</p>
</div>
<p>Our task is to translate this data into the form of a function that takes time as input and returns temperature as output. Such a model would be useful for, say, filling in the gaps of the data. For instance, we might want to find the temperature of the water immediately after being poured from the kettle into the mug.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, one sees that the temperature decreases along a curve: cooling fast at first and then more slowly. This is the pattern of the flipped right-for-left exponential. (Figure <a href="#fig:four-variations"><strong>??</strong></a>(B)) We can imagine then that an exponential, <span class="math inline">\(A e^{kt} + C\)</span> will be a suitable model form for the cooling water.</p>
<p>What remains is to find the parameters <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Here is a general process for curve-fitting an exponential. Later, we’ll apply this process specifically to the water-cooling situation.</p>
<p><strong>General process for curve-fitting an exponential</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 0</strong>: Check that the data show an exponential pattern in one of its variations, namely a smooth increase or decrease and leveling out beyond some value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If this isn’t true, reconsider whether you should be using an exponential function in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Do the data show exponential growth or exponential decay? If it’s exponential growth, then the flat region in Step 0 will be to the left and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will be positive. If exponential decay, the flat region will be to the right and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> will be negative.</p>
<p>Notice that the question of “growth or decay” depends only on the sign of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. You can have an exponentially decaying process that’s increasing. Consider, for instance, the speed of a car as it merges onto a highway from a slow speed on the entrance ramp. The car’s velocity is increasing, but as you approach highway speed the rate of increase gets smaller. That’s exponential decay.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Where is the baseline? We’re going to put aside <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for the moment and find the value of the output that is being approached asymptotically, that is, the height of the level zone of the data. This height is the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in the linear combination.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Once you know the baseline, you’re set to find a numerical value for the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Pick a point in the data far from the baseline. Call the input <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Scan forward or backward in time to find a point in the data that’s vertically half way from the original point toward the baseline. Call the input at that point <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/2}\)</span>. The difference between these, <span class="math inline">\(t_1 - t_{1/2}\)</span> is called the <strong><em>half-life</em></strong> or <strong><em>halving-time</em></strong> if it’s negative and the <strong><em>doubling time</em></strong> if it’s positive.</li>
<li>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(0.693 / (t_1 - t_{1/2})\)</span>. Double check the sign of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to make sure it’s consistent with what you saw in Step 1. (Incidently, <span class="math inline">\(0.693 = \ln(2)\)</span>. The 2 is the same as the 2 in doubling or halving.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Now that you have numerical values for the baseline <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, calculating the value of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is straightforward.<br>
i. Pick a <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> that’s reasonably well represented in your data. Find the vertical coordinate represented by the data near that <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>. Call that <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span>.
ii. Solve with respect to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the equation <span class="math inline">\(A + B e^{k t_0} = {\cal D}\)</span>. Things are particularly easy if you can use <span class="math inline">\(t_0 = 0\)</span>. Then you just straight off calculate <span class="math inline">\(B = {\cal D} - A\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Plot the function <span class="math inline">\(A + B e^{k t}\)</span> using the values for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> that you just found. If you are not satisfied, tweak the parameters a bit until you are.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential curve fitting applied to the water-cooling data</strong></p>
<p>Let’s illustrate the general process on the water-cooling data, redrawn in Figure <a href="process-of-modeling.html#fig:Fun-4-a-2-1">7.6</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:Fun-4-a-2-1"></span>

Figure 7.6: The cooling-water data, repeated here for convenience.
</p>
</div>
<p>Step 0: The data indicate a smooth curve. As <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> gets large, the curve approaches a constant. So an exponential model is reasonable.</p>
<p>Step 1: The flat zone of the data is to the right. So we’ve got exponential decay and <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step 2: The curve looks like it’s leveling out at a temperature of about 25 degrees C for large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(A \approx 25^{\circ} \text{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The point furthest from the baseline is located at <span class="math inline">\(t_1 = 15 \text{sec}\)</span> with a value <span class="math inline">\({\cal D} \approx 80^\circ\text{C}\)</span>.</li>
<li>This if <span class="math inline">\(55^\circ\text{C}\)</span> from the baseline. We want to find the value of <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> where the temperature will be half way from 80 to the baseline. That’s a temperature of about <span class="math inline">\(80 - 55/2 = 53.5\)</span>. Scanning over to the right, the function that I can imagine going through the data crossed <span class="math inline">\(53^\circ\)</span> at about <span class="math inline">\(t_{1/2} = 40\)</span>. Thus, the half-life is estimated at 25s.</li>
<li>The parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is therefore $k<span class="math inline">\(0.693 / \mbox{half-life}) = - 0.63 / 25 = -0.0277\)</span>. Since we identified in Step 1 that exponential decay is involved, we expect <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to be negative. It is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>We know <span class="math inline">\(A \approx 25\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k \approx -0.0277\)</span>. We also now that for <span class="math inline">\(t=15\)</span> the function output is about <span class="math inline">\({\cal D} = 80^\circ\)</span>.</li>
<li>This means <span class="math inline">\(25^\circ + B e^{- 0.0277 \times 15} \approx 80^\circ = 25 + 0.66 B\)</span>. Solving for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(B = (80 - 25)/0.66 = 83.3\)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 5. Graph the function over the data.</p>

Figure 7.8: About four days of tide-level data from Providence, Rhode Island
</p>
</div>
<p>It’s not too hard to see what’s going on. The tide rises and falls about every 12 hours. The difference between high tide and low tide is a little more than one meter. The tide gauge is calibrated so that a typical reading is 1 meter, although we don’t know what that is respect to. (Certainly not sea level, since then the typical reading would be around zero.)</p>
<p>This simple description tells almost everything needed to construct an A/B model of the tide level using a sinusoid, that is, a function of the form <span class="math display">\[A + B \sin(2\pi t/P)\]</span> The procedure is straightforward:</p>
<p><strong>Step 0</strong>: Determine whether a sinusoid model is appropriate. As you know, sinusoids oscillate up and down repeatedly with a steady <strong><em>period</em></strong>. That certainly seems the case here. But sinusoids are also steady in the <strong><em>peak</em></strong> and <strong><em>trough</em></strong> values for each cycle. That’s only approximately true in the Providence data. Models inevitably involve approximation. We’ll have to keep an eye on whether the <strong><em>fixed amplitude</em></strong> feature of sinusoids</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose a sensible value to represent the low point repeatedly reached. 0.5 m seems appropriate here, but obviously the exact position of the trough of each cycle varies over the 4.5 day duration of the data. Similarly, the peak is near 1.6 m. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the mean of the peak and trough values: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.6 + 0.5}{2} = 1.05\)</span> m here. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is half the difference between the peak and trough values: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.6 - 0.5}{2} = 0.55\)</span>. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is called the <strong><em>baseline</em></strong> of the sinusoid. Paramter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the <strong><em>amplitude</em></strong>. (Note that by convention, the amplitude is always <em>half</em> the high-to-low range of the sinusoid.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Estimate the period <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the sinusoid. This can be done with a ruler: the horizontal duration of a complete cycle. I like to use the time between peaks, but the time between troughs would work just as well. Another good choice is the time between positive sloping crossings of the baseline. (But be careful. The time between <em>successive</em> baseline crossings, one positive sloping and the other negative, give just <em>half</em> the period.)</p>
<p>On the scale of the above plot, it’s hard to read off the time of the first peak. So, zoom in until it becomes more obvious.</p>

<p>It looks like our estimate of the half-life is a bit too small; the data doesn’t seem to decay at the rate implied by <span class="math inline">\(k = -0.0277\)</span>. Perhaps we should try <span class="math inline">\(k = -0.2\)</span> and go on from there.</p>

<p>The refined parameters give a much better fit to the data than our original rough estimates by eye.</p>
<p>We had two rounds of the <strong><em>modeling cycle</em></strong>. First, choice of an A/B expontential model and a rough estimate of the parameters A, B, and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Second, refinement of those parameters using the computer.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of the second round, the experienced modeler can see some disturbing discrepancies. First, the estimated baseline appears to be too high. Related, the initial decay of the model function doesn’t seem to be fast enough and the decay of the model function for large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> appears to be too slow. Prof. Stan Wagon noticed this. He used additional data to fill in the gaps for small <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and refined his model further by changing the basis functions in the linear combination. He hypothesized that there are at least two different cooling processes. First, the newly poured water raises the temperature of the mug itself. Since the water and mug are in direct contact, this is a fast process. Then, the complete water/mug unit comes slowly into equilibrium with the room temperature.</p>
<p>The newly refined model was a even better match to the data. But nothing’s perfect and Prof. Wagon saw an opportunity for additional refinement based on the idea that there is a third physical mechanism of cooling: evaporation from the surface of the hot water. Prof. Wagon’s additional circuits of the modeling cycle were appropriate to his purpose, which was to develop a detailed understanding of the process of cooling. For other purposes, such as demonstrating the appropriateness of an exponential process or interpolating between the data points, earlier cycles might have sufficed.</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of the model Prof. Wagon constructed to match the data.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>This is an excellent match to the data. But … matching the data isn’t always the only goal of modeling. Prof. Wagon wanted to make sure the model was physically plausible. And looking at the refined parameters, which include two exponential processes with parameters <span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>, he saw something wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But what can we make of <span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span>, whose [positive value] violates the laws of thermodynamics by suggesting that the water gets hotter by virtue of its presence in the cool air? The most likely problem is that our simple model (the proportionality assumption) is not adequate near the boiling point. There are many complicated factors that affect heat transportation, such as air movement, boundary layer dissipation, and diffusion, and our use of a single linear relationship appears to be inadequate. In the next section [of our paper] we suggest some further experiments, but we also hope that our experiments might inspire readers to come up with a better mathematical model.</em></p>

<p>The modeling cycle can go round and round!</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Evaluate and refine. The green model would make poor predictions. The model says “high tide” when the data say otherwise. What’s missing is the <strong><em>phase</em></strong> of the sinusoid. A model that incorporates the phase is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\color{blue}\mbox{tide}(t) \equiv 1.05 + 0.55 \sin(2\pi (t - t_0)/11)}\]</span></p>
<p>The new parameter, <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, should be set to be the time of a positive-going crossing of the baseline. There’s such a crossing at about time = 17. Happily, changing the phase does not itself necessitate re-estimating the other parameters: baseline, amplitude, period. This model, incorporating the phase, has been graphed in <span class="math inline">\(\color{blue}\mbox{blue}\)</span>.</p>

<p>For some modeling purposes, such as prediction of future tides, the phase information is impossible. For others, say, description of the amplitude of the tides, not. But getting the phase roughly right can help point out other problems. For instance, having the blue sinusoid for comparison makes it clear that the estimated period of 11 hours is too short. Maybe 13 hours would be better. Better still, since at <span class="math inline">\(t=t_0 = 17\)</span> the model is a close match to the data, let’s use that as the estimate of the start of a cycle. But then, let’s move much further along in the data to find another baseline crossing. To judge from the right panel, there is a baseline crossing at <span class="math inline">\(t=103\)</span>. The difference between these two times is <span class="math inline">\(103 - 17 = 86\)</span> hours. Of course, the period is not 86 hours. Looking back at the whole set of data we can see 7 complete cycles between <span class="math inline">\(t=17\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t=103\)</span>. So our new estimate of the period is <span class="math inline">\(86/7 = 12.3\)</span> hours.</p>
<p>With this refinement the model is
<span class="math display">\[{\color{violet}\mbox{tide}(t) \equiv 1.05 + 0.55 \sin(2\pi (t - 17)/12.3)}\]</span></p>

<p>That’s a pretty good match to the data! We might call it quits at that. First, let’s polish up the parameter estimates, letting the computer do the tedious work of trying little tweaks to see if it can improve the fit.</p>

<p>This last model seems capable of making reasonable predictions, so if we collected up-to-date data we might be able to fit a new model to predict the tide level pretty accurately a few days ahead of time. Also, the excellent alignment of the model peaks with the data tell us that the cyclic tide has a period that constant, at least so far as well can tell.</p>
<p>With the period estimate <span class="math inline">\(P=12.56\)</span> hours, we can go looking for other phenomena that might account for the tides. The period of the day-night cycle is, of course 24 hours. So the tides in Providence come in and out twice a day. But not exactly. Something else must be going on.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton was the first to propose that the tides were caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon. A complete cycle of the Moon—moon rise to moon rise—takes about 50 minutes longer than a full day: the Earth revolves once every 24 hours, but in that time the Moon has moved a bit further on in its orbit of the Earth. So the Moon’s period, seen from a fixed place on Earth is about 24.8 hours. Half of this, 12.4 hours, is awfully close to our estimate of the tidal period: 12.56 hours. The difference in periods, 8 minutes a day, might be hard to observe over only 4 days. Maybe with more data we’d get a better match between the tides and the moon.</p>
<p>This is the modeling cycle at work: Propose a model form (A/B model with sinusoid), adjust parameters to match what we know (the Providence tide record), compare the model to the data, observe discrepancies, propose a refined model. You can stop the model when it is giving you what you need. The period 12.56 hour model seems good enough to make a prediction of the tide level a few days ahead, and is certainly better than the “two tides a day” model. But our model is not yet able to implicate precisely the Moon’s orbit in in tidal oscillations.</p>
<p>Discrepancies between a model and data play two roles: they help us decide if the model is fit for the purpose we have in mind and they can point the way to improved models. That the tidal data deviates from the steady amplitude of our model can be a clue for where to look next. It’s not always obvious where this will lead.</p>
<p>Historically, careful analysis of tides led to a highly detailed, highly accurate model: a linear combination of sinusoids with diurnal periods 12.42, 12.00, 12.66, and 11.97 hours as well components with period 23.93, 25.82, 24.07, 26.87, and 24.00 hours. A tide-prediction model is constructed by finding the coefficients of the linear combination; these differ from locale to locale.</p>
