</h1>
<p>For our purposes, the definition of calculus is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The use of functions to model and explore continuous change</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of the words in this definition is used in everyday speech. Still they require some explanation because we are using them to describe mathematical topics. The task of this chapter is to connect, in a preliminary way, the words “function,”, “model,” “continuous,” and “change” to their meanings in calculus.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Naked modeling functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#naked-modeling-functions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Here is a list of functions most of which you have probably seen many times in your mathematics studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{x}\)</span>, and so on.</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(e^x\)</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(2^x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(10^x\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cos(x)\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\log_2(x)\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see these functions—or something very much like them—throughout this book. As such, it might be appropriate to call them “core” functions. But we will not. Instead, we refer to these as the <strong><em>naked modeling functions</em></strong>.</p>
<p>There’s mathematics … and then there’s the real world. The term <strong><em>mathematical modeling</em></strong> is about constructing representations of situations or phenomena in the real world in terms of mathematical objects. The advantage of being able to construct models is that models are easy to study, explore, take apart, do experiments on, and deduce the implications of.</p>
<p>We use computers to interact with the world, whether that be record-keeping, communications, media displays, and so on. The “things” that computers work with are always mathematical representations of the real world: models. Computers carry out operations on models. For instance, sound is a real-world phenomenon that resides somewhere between the vibrations of air and the psycho-acoustics of the brain. A simple computer representation of sound is constructed using mathematical stuff: a long series of numbers. Suppose we want to <em>slow down</em> sound (say, for someone learning a foreign language) or to speed it up (to get through a slow-paced video) or to translate it into text. The technologies for doing these things are almost always implemented by doing arithmetic or more complicated mathematical procedures on the mathematical stuff.</p>
<p>A major theme of this course is how to make such mathematical representations of real-world phenomena and how to work with the representations to extract the results we want. In particular, we will focus on representations in the form of mathematical functions. (There are other mathematical representations, but functions have a special importance and are ubiquitous in scientific work and computing.)</p>
<p>As you’ll see, when we need a new function for some purpose, we practically always build it out of existing functions. That brings us back to the <strong><em>naked modeling functions</em></strong>. The collection listed above is not only familiar to many students, but are far and away the most commonly used in building models.</p>
<p>And yet … We are being a bit disrespectful in calling them <strong><em>naked modeling functions</em></strong>. The word “naked” suggests that they are not yet ready to go out into the real world. Later, we will translate the naked modeling functions into <strong><em>basic modeling functions</em></strong> that are dressed and ready to engage the real world.</p>

<div id="change-and-slope" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Change and slope<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#change-and-slope"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>You already know what “change” means. In mathematics, and especially the mathematics of functions, change has a very simple meaning that you have already touched on in your previous math education.</p>
<p>The word that encapsulates “change” in high-school math is <strong><em>slope</em></strong>. For instance, you’ve undoubtedly had to calculate the slope of a straight line in a graph. You learned about “rise” and “run” and how to read them from a graph or from a formula. The slope is the ratio: rise over run.</p>
<p>Slope is a lovely <strong><em>metaphor</em></strong> for change, since everyone has a intuitive sense of the slope of a road or of a hillside. You learned to apply this intuition to reading graphs and the slope of a line. We’ll exploit the intuitive ability to read a landscape in order to introduce abstract mathematical ideas in a down-to-earth setting. It’s a very effective pedagogical strategy.</p>
<p>But not everything that changes has a “slope.” For instance, the population of a country can change, as can the number of new cases of an epidemic disease, the temperature of a cup of coffee, or the distance from Earth of a spacecraft. A major part of learning calculus is generalizing and abstracting the mathematical concept of which “slope” is an example and becoming proficient with mathematical procedures for working with change.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Continuous change<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#continuous-change"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Most people are comfortable with the ideas of daily changes in temperature or monthly changes in credit-card debt or quarterly changes in the unemployment rate or annual changes in the height of a child. Such things are easy to record in, say, a spreadsheet. For example, as I write, the weather forecast for the next several days (in southeastern Colorado in mid-May) is</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Day</th>
<th>High</th>
<th>Low</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Thursday</td>
<td>73</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>sunny</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Friday</td>
<td>72</td>
<td>48</td>
<td>windy</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Saturday</td>
<td>66</td>
<td>48</td>
<td>thunderstorms</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sunday</td>
<td>68</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>windy</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Monday</td>
<td>70</td>
<td>39</td>
<td>sunny</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Tuesday</td>
<td>70</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>sunny</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Wednesday</td>
<td>66</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>partly cloudy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>Such data is said to be <strong><em>discrete</em></strong>. The day is listed, but not the time of day. The high temperature is forecast, but not the time of that high. The “description” is also discrete, one of the several words that are used to summarize the quality of the weather, as opposed to the quantity of rain.</p>
<p>Calculus is about <strong><em>continuous change</em></strong>. For instance, if the weather bureau provide a web interface that let me enter the date and time to the nearest fraction of a second, they would be giving a way to track the change <strong><em>continuously</em></strong>. Many physical processes are intrinsically continuous, for instance the motion (change in position) of a spacecraft or the height of the tide or the stress on a tree as a function of wind velocity.</p>
<p>Finding a language to describe continuous change—famously, the position of the moon or planets in their orbit, or the speed of a ball rolling down a ramp—was central to the emergence of what historians call the “Age of Enlightenment” or “modern scientific method.” The first complete presentation of that language was published by Isaac Newton based on his work in the 1660s. As you might guess, the name of the language is “calculus.”</p>

<p>Point out that only the straight-line function has a slope that is the same everywhere. The other naked modeling functions don’t have <em>a slope</em>, they have a local property that is a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>

<p>So much of what we will do in calculus depends on being able to construct and manipulate functions. Doing this successfully requires a more careful consideration of how we know when something is a function and the anatomy of functions generally. The major way this is accomplished both in mathematical notation and computer languages is via <strong><em>notation</em></strong>, the subject of the next chapter.</p>
