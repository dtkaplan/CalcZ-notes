</h1>
<p>When we need a new function for some purpose, we practically always build it out of existing functions. For instance, a parameterized function like <span class="math display">\[A \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P}x\right) + C\]</span> is built by assempling together a straight-line input scaling, a naked <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> function, and another straight-line function for scaling the output from <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll introduce three general frameworks for combining functions: linear combination, composition, and multiplication.</p>
<div id="linear-combination" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Linear combination<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#linear-combination"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>One of the most widely used sorts of combination is called a <strong><em>linear combination</em></strong>. The mathematics of linear combination is, it happens, at the core of the use of math in applications, whether that be constructing a Google-like search engine or analyzing medical data to see if a treatment has a positive effect.</p>
<p>You’ve worked for many years with one kind of linear combination: polynomials. No doubt you’ve seen functions<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that you saw polynomials as things to be factored, rather than as functions taking an input and producing an output. So they were written as &lt;em&gt;equations&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(e x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a> like <span class="math display">\[f(x) \equiv 3 x^2 + 5 x - 2\]</span></p>
<p>There are three modeling functions in this polynomial. In this case, as in polynomials generally, they are all power-law functions: <span class="math inline">\(g_0(x) \equiv 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_1(x) \equiv x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g_2(x) \equiv x^2\)</span>. With these functions defined, we can write the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[f(x) \equiv 3 g_2(x) + 5 g_1(x) - 2 g_0(x)\]</span>
Each of the functions is being scaled by a quantity—3, 5, and -2 in this example—and the scaled functions are added up. That’s a linear combination; scale and add. (Later, we’ll see that the <strong><em>scalars</em></strong> generally come with units. So we might well have a metric polynomial and an equivalent traditional-unit polynomial. Just wait.)</p>
<div class="why">
<p>Notice that we said <span class="math inline">\(g_0(x) \equiv 1\)</span> is a power-law function. Why? Since <span class="math inline">\(x^0=1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we might equally well have written <span class="math inline">\(g_0(x) \equiv x^0\)</span> which is visibly a power-law function.</p>
<p>We’re just trying to emphasize that a polynomial is a linear combination of power-law functions, in particular those power-law functions with whole-number, positive exponents. The individual functions, say, <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x^5\)</span> are called <strong><em>monomials</em></strong>. A polynomial is a combination of monomials, just like a chemical polymer is a combination of monomers.</p>
</div>
<p>There are other places where you have seen linear combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parameterized <strong><em>sinusoid</em></strong> <span class="math display">\[A \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P}t\right) + C\]</span> is a linear combination of the functions <span class="math inline">\(h_1(t) \equiv \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{P} t\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_0(t) \equiv 1\)</span>. The scalars are <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>The parameterized <strong><em>exponential</em></strong> <span class="math display">\[A e^{kt} + C\]</span> The functions being combined are <span class="math inline">\(e^{kt}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_0(t) \equiv 1\)</span>. The scalars are, again, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>The straight line function <span class="math inline">\(a x + b\)</span>. The functions being combined are <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the scalars are <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that neither the parameterized exponential or the parameterized sinusoid is a polynomial.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for us to be introducing linear combinations here.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You will see linear combinations everywhere once you know to look for them.</li>
<li>There is a highly refined mathematical theory of linear combinations that gives us powerful ways to think about them as well as computer software that can quickly find the best scalars to use to match input-output data.</li>
<li>The concept of linear combination generalizes the simple idea that we have been calling “scaling the output.” From now on, we’ll use the linear-combination terminology and avoid the narrower idea of “scaling the output.”</li>
<li>Many physical systems are described by linear combinations. For instance, the motion of a vibrating molecule or a helicopter in flight or a building shaken by an earthquake are described in terms of simple “modes” which are linearly combined to make up the entire motion. More down to Earth, the timbre of a musical instrument is set by the scalars in a linear combination of pure tones.</li>
<li>Many modeling tasks can be put into the framework of choosing an appropriate set of simple functions to combine and then (letting the computer) figure out the best scalars to use in the combination.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even better, there is an automatic, reliable, and fast algorithm for finding the scalars for a set of functions that are to be combined to match data as closely as possible. So the modeler just has to select the functions to be used, the computer can find the coefficients. (We’ll explore the mathematics and methods of linear combinations, usually called <strong><em>linear algebra</em></strong>, in Block 5.)</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Function composition<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#function-composition"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>To <strong><em>compose</em></strong> two functions, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, means to apply one of the functions to the output of the other. “<span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> composed with <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span>” means <span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span>. This is generally very different from “<span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> composed with <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>” which means <span class="math inline">\(g(f(x))\)</span>.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you have recorded the outdoor temperature over the course of a day and packaged this into a function <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{AirTemp}(t)\)</span>: temperature as a function of time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Your digital thermometer uses degrees Celsius, but you want the output units to be degrees Kelvin. The conversion function is <span class="math display">\[\mbox{CtoK}(C) \equiv C + 273.15\]</span>
Notice that CtoK() takes temperature as input. With this, we can write the “Kelvin as a function of time” as <span class="math display">\[\mbox{CtoK}\left(\mbox{AirTemp}(t)\right)\]</span>
It’s important to distinguish the above time <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Kelvin function from something that looks very much the same but is utterly different: <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{AirTemp}\left(\mbox{CtoK}(t)\right)\)</span>. As a matter of arithmetic, you can put time as an input to CtoK(). But it has a completely different meaning in terms of the real world. If time were measured in hours, then CtoK<span class="math inline">\((t)\)</span> would be looking at the temperature eleven and a half days ago, instead of the temperature at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>We used <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> as the name of the input to CtoK(). Shouldn’t it be something like <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the names of the inputs to a function can be anything whatsoever, so long as they are used consistently in the function algorithm. If we wanted, we could call the first input to any function <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, or for that matter <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or giraffe.</p>
<p>The point of the notation <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{CtoK}(C) \equiv C + 273.15\)</span> is to make it utterly clear that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the name we’re using for the input by listing it in the parentheses that follow the function name CtoK(). This, unlike high-school notation, allows us great freedom in the choice of names.</p>
<p>We can use that freedom to make it easier to communicate with other people. (And remember, one of those other people is “future you.”) We used the name <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to reinforce the message that CtoK() converts <em>celsius</em> to <em>kelvin</em>, and not vice versa.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is a simple, approximate formula for the length of day (in hours) as a function of latitude <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and the declination angle <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> of the sun.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{day_length}(L, \delta) \equiv \frac{2}{15} \arccos\left(-\tan(L)*\tan(δ)\right)\]</span>
The declination angle is the latitude of the point on the earth’s surface pierced by an imagined line connecting the centers of the earth and the sun. On the summer solstice, it is <span class="math inline">\(23.44^\circ\)</span>, the longest day of the year.</p>
<p>A computer implement must look different, since <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> are typically provided in degrees while the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Trig.html">tan()</a></code> and other trigonometric functions in most computer languages expect units of radians. The conversion is easy: <span class="math inline">\(\text{deg2rad}(d) \equiv \frac{\pi}{180} d\)</span>. The conversion the other way is <span class="math inline">\(\text{rad2deg}(r) \equiv \frac{180}{\pi} r\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to get the day-length formula to work in a computer, we have to compose the <span class="math inline">\(\tan()\)</span> function with <code>deg2rad()</code>. The output of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Trig.html">acos()</a></code> is in radians, so we have to convert it back to degrees. Like this:</p>

<span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> The modeling polynomial<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#modeling-polynomial-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes, in order to model some simple relationship you need to build a function whose graph has a simple, curving shape.</p>
<p>A simple but surprisingly powerful approach is to use a <strong><em>low-order polynomial</em></strong>. The <strong><em>order of a polynomial</em></strong> is the highest exponent on the input. For example, a straight-line function, <span class="math inline">\(g_1(x) \equiv a_0 + a_1 x\)</span>, is a <strong>first-order</strong> polynomial. A <strong><em>quadratic</em></strong>, <span class="math inline">\(g_2(x) \equiv b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2\)</span> is a <strong>second-order</strong> polynomial.</p>
<p>Many modelers are tempted to extend the technique to third-, fourth-, fifth-order and even higher. This is only rarely worthwhile since all second-, fourth-, sixth- and higher-even-order <strong><em>monomials</em></strong> have basically the same U-shape, like a referee signalling a touch-down. Similarly, first-, third-, fifth- and higher odd-order monomial have similar <img src="www/cubic.png"> shapes.</p>
<p>An ofttimes better approach is to compose the polynomial with a curved but monotonic function, such as a logarithm.</p>

</h2>
<p>The third in our repertoire of methods for making new function out of old is plain old multiplication. With two functions <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>, the product is simply <span class="math inline">\(f(x)g(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>It’s essential to distinguish between function multiplication and function composition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\underbrace{f(x) g(x)}_\mbox{multiplication}\ \ \ \ \underbrace{f(g(x)) \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \ g(f(x))}_\mbox{composition}\]</span></p>
<p>In function composition, only one of the functions—the <strong><em>interior function</em></strong> is applied to the overall input, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the above example. The other function gets its input from the output of its partner.</p>
<p>In multiplication, each of the functions is applied to the input individually. Then their outputs are multiplied to produce the overall output.</p>
<p>In function composition, the order of the functions matters: <span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(f(x))\)</span> are in general completely different functions.</p>
<p>In function multiplication, the order doesn’t matter because multiplication is <strong><em>commutative</em></strong>, that is, if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are each quantities, <span class="math inline">\(a \times b = b \times a\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Transient vibration</em></strong></p>
<p>A guitar string is plucked to produce a note. The note is, of course, vibrations of the air created by vibrations of the string.</p>
<p>After plucking, the note fades away. An important model of this is a sinusoid (of the correct period to correspond to the frequency of the note) times an exponential.</p>
<p>Function multiplication is used so often in modeling that you’ll see it in many modeling situations. Here’s one example that is important in physics and communication: the <strong><em>wave packet.</em></strong> Overall, the wave packet is a localized oscillation as in Figure @ref{fig:wave-packet}.</p>

Each simple function such as a hump, a sigmoid, a straight-line function, or a sinusoid can be likened to a character in a story. For instance, a sinusoid with a period of 10 seconds and an amplitude of 5 feet might be all we need to say about the shaking encountered in an earthquake. A sigmoid might be a good description of the uptake of a social media platform such as Facebook. 

Many stories require more than one character. For instance, the initial rise in popularity  of social media platform might be exponential, then turning into a sigmoid, then an eventual exponential decay as popularity wanes as with Yik Yak.

Being able to add or multiply functions can enable us to  tell a more complicated story. For example, the  graph shows a simple model of the hourly  temperature in from June through September


```r
temp <- makeFun(20*cos(2*pi*(t-120)/365) + 
                  10*sin(2*pi*t/1) + 50 ~ t)
slice_plot(temp(day) ~ day, domain(day=c(90, 180)),  npt=1000) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Temperature  (F)", x = "Day of year")
```

<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-126-1.png" width="672" />

You can see in the graph the slow seasonal change in  temperature represented by a sine  function with a period of 365 days, as well as the relatively rapid hour-by-hour variation over the course of 24 hours. There are two different mechanisms at  work, 1) the annual orbit of the Earth around the Sun  which creates the seasons,  2) the daily rotation of the Earth around its axis. Each mechanism is approximated by a simple function. The  overall  pattern can be represented by  a sum of functions.

We are going to use this strategy of modeling complex phenomena as a  sum of two or more simple functions.

**Problem 1** Epidemics are often modeled as a series of "waves." Each wave involves different  people. Let's imagine two epidemic waves, one passing through the "blue" population  and a smaller one through  the "red" population, like this:

<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-127-1.png" width="672" />



::: {.etude-question}

**Q-36**: Assuming that there were no way to distinguish between red and blue cases, the epidemic would look like just one curve. Which of the following curves would the overall epidemic look like? (The colors are just  to  help you  distinguish the different functions)


#. A [The cumulative number of cases can't possibly go down!]

#. B [The cumulative number of cases can't possibly go down!]

#. C [You can't see the separate waves in (C) even though the rise in the blue wave is clearly distinct in  time from the rise in  the red wave. ]

#. D  (+) [Yes. Each wave adds another layer to the cumulative number of cases]

:::


<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-128-1.png" width="672" />

Each of the functions shown in the above graph is a "linear combination" of the red function and the blue function. The real total cumulative cases is "wave1(t)"  plus "wave2(t)". The other functions are made up and are irrelevant to the real epidemic. Still, we can ask what arithmetic combination of "wave1(t)" and "wave2(t)"  was used to create the made-up function.


::: {.etude-question}

**Q-37**: For made-up function (A) in  the graph, what was the linear combination?


#. 1000 - wave1(t) + wave2(t)  (+) []

#. 2*wave1(t) - 3*wave2(t) [When t=0,  both wave1(t) and wave2(t) are zero, so the sum would also be zero. That's not  true in function (A)]

#. 1000 + wave1(t) - wave2(t) [This  linear combination would rise from 1000 to 2000 (at time t=100) and  then  fall off to 1500 as the negative  wave2(t)  comes into play.]

One common measure of quality of life is "life expectancy at birth." A measure of the availability of  health  care is the number of physicians per 1000 people.

The question we are going to examine is whether life expectancy is a function of the availability of health care  and, if so, what kind of function  it is.

The data frame `LifeExpectancyPhysicians` contains the official 2010 figures from  many countries for life  expectancy and  the number of physicians per 1000 population.

Graph `LifeExpectancy` versus `Physicians`. Use linear axes, semi-log axes, or log-log axes to determine a reasonable functional form. (Recall  that giving `scale_y_log10()` as  an argument to  `gf_refine()` will set the y axis on  a log scale, and  similarly for the x axis.)

::: {.scaffolding}

```r
gf_point(LifeExpectancy ~ Physicians,
         data = LifeExpectancyPhysicians) %>%
  gf_refine()
```

<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-135-1.png" width="672" />
:::

Using `fitModel()`, your instructor found the following model of life-expectancy (which we'll call L, in years) as a function of physicians-per-1000 people. (We'll call this "doctor-density" for short, so D.)

The instructor's model is:

$$L(D) \equiv 70.9 \times D^{0.0683}$$
Define this function in R and graph it over your  data. Confirm that it is a reasonable match to the data. (If not, you've copied the parameters  wrong.)

::: {.etude-question}

**Q-42**: What kind of function is the instructor's proposed model?


#. linear [Is it  a straight line on  linear axes?]

#. exponential [Is it a straight line on semi-log axes?]

#. power-law  (+) [C is a consonant, Chub]

#. sigmoidal [Is it S-shaped]

:::


::: {.etude-question}

**Q-43**: According to  the instructor's model, what's the life expectancy when there are no physicians at all?


#. 0 years  (+) [Not very believable, since there were (living) people before there were physicians. The power-law functional form always forces zero input to be zero output. So maybe not to be taken so seriously.]

#. 35 years []

#. 50 years []

#. 70 years []

#. 100 years []

#. 115 years []

:::

::: {.etude-question}

**Q-44**: According to  the instructor's model, would be the  life expectancy if every person in the world were a physician? (Hint: Translate this into physicians/1000-people.)


#. 0 years []

#. 35 years []

#. 50 years []

#. 70 years []

#. 100 years []

#. 110 years+  (+) [But probably  we would all starve to  death if everybody was a physician! This also is an unreasonable extrapolation.]

:::


It could  be argued that the doctor-density should be a function  of life  expectancy rather than  the other way around. (All those seniors consume a lot of medical care.)


::: {.etude-question}

**Q-45**: Which of these models agrees reasonably well with the data? (Hint: You can plot the model over the data.)


#. $D(L) \equiv 7.24\times 10^{-19} \times L^9.8$  (+) []

#. $D(L) \equiv 3.19 \times L^{3.1}$ []

#. $D(L) \equiv 8.64 \times L^{6.3}$ []

#. $D(L) \equiv 5.50 \times L^{2.4}$ []

:::

The question now is whether the function $D(L)$ (from the previous question) which  is a good match to the data, is equivalent to  the function $L(D)$ which the instructor first proposed.

In order to compare them, we have to make both of them  functions of the same input. Let's say we take  $D(L)$ and algebraically  find the inverse which we'll call $D^{inv}(D)$. That inverse function takes an input in the form D and produces an output  in the form L.

Using algebra, confirm that

$$D^{inv}(D) \equiv  70.9 \times D^{1/9.8}$$
In the sandbox, plot both the instructor's proposed model $L(D)$ and the model $D^{inv}(D)$ on the same axes, along with  the data. (You'll have to decide which variable to put  on  the horizontal axis, but the notation $L(D)$ and $D^{inv}(D)$ should give you  a good clue.)

::: {.etude-question}

**Q-46**: Which model,  $L(D)$ or $D^{inv}(D)$ is  a better match to the data when $D < 1$?


#. $L(D)$  (+) []

#. $D^{inv}(D)$ []

#. They are the same function. []

:::

Complex social phenomena, like life expectancy, are  ... well, complex. Life expectancy depends on many factors other than health care: nutrition, war, automobile safety, etc.

Notice from the data that the countries with the highest life expectancies are those where $D  \approx 3$. And yet, there  are many countries with $D \approx 3$ that have relatively low  life expectancy. One reason for this is inequality. In many countries, urbanites live at a high  standard  and people in the countryside have very little access to health care or reliably good nutrition, civil order, and so on.
