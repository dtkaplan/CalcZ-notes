</h1>
<p>As you know, a function takes one or more inputs and returns a value as output. The functions we examine in CalcZ take <em>quantities</em> as inputs and return a <em>quantity</em> as an output.
The algorithm that forms the body of the function describes arithmetic and other calculations that can turn the inputs into the output.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also use <strong><em>tables</em></strong> as functions. With a table, you specify the input, look up that input in one of the colums of the table which brings you to the right row. Then read out from that row the value in another column to be the output. The quantitative operation needed for table lookup is simple comparison. The floor/corridor/door metaphor describes table lookup as well as function evaluation.</p>
<p>In the previous block, we constructed functions to represent the patterns seen in data. In one example, we constructed a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t) = A + B e^{-k t}\)</span> to represent the temperature of water cooling in a mug as a function of time. In another example, we summarized the pattern of rising and falling tides.</p>
<p>It’s common sense that data is stored in tables. But we could easily represent any smooth mathematical function, such as our basic modeling functions, as a table look-up problem. Indeed, in the era before computers, many mathematical functions were used in exactly this manner: a printed table in which a person could search for a match to the input and retrieve a value for the output.</p>
<div class="todo">
<p>[Picture of some nice old table.]</p>
</div>
<p>In the computer era, we still routinely represent functions this way: data stored in computer files. For instance, an MP3 file is not much more than a sequence of numbers that record a complicated function of time: the air pressure variations of sound. Similarly, digital images record functions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> over a limited domain. Given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as input, you can look up the output by going to the right pixel.</p>
<p>We humans of course, don’t perceive the numerical output of either sound or image functions: we <strong>hear</strong> a sound and we <strong>see</strong> an image. We’ve got special biological equipment for this!</p>
<p>Consider the image in Figure @ref{fig:sand-1}. It is a picture of some indentations in a small area of sand, about two inches wide in the middle of a hiking trail. The dots are individual grains of sand.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="www/sand-furrows.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Can you see three almost parallel furrows? How about the small crater in the upper left?</p>
<p>You can see the individual grains of sand because they contrast sharply with their neighbors. Or, more precisely, you can see a few dozen grains <strong>because</strong> they contrast sharply with their neighbors.</p>
<p>You can think of the surface of the sand as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. It’s lower in some places and higher in others. But, in fact, you can’t see the height of an individual point in the photograph. In the right light, you wouldn’t notice the furrows at all. But the way the picture is lighted, raking sunlight from the left, the surface is translated into broad regions of brightness and shadow. In the light regions, the surface slants toward the sun. In the shadows, the surface slants away from the sun.</p>
<p>What you’re mainly seeing in the photo is the <strong><em>slant</em></strong> or <strong><em>slope</em></strong> of the surface. The light has transformed <em>elevation</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> into <em>slant</em> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and then encoded the slant as brightness, in much the same way the background of a contour plot encodes the output of the function as a color.</p>
<p>The moral here is that sometimes the data in a function is not in the right form for us to extract useful information. But by transforming that data to represent contrast or difference or slope, the information can be revealed.</p>
<p>This Block is about transforming functions to show difference and slope. Such transformation, accomplished by mathematics rather than the raking light of the sun, can take a pattern that we’re presented with and turn it into another pattern that can tell us what we want to know.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Average rate of change<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#average-rate-of-change"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<div class="objectives" latex-data="">
<ol>
<li>
<strong>[Deriv-2a]</strong> <em>Identify the “average rate of change” of a function over an interval as the overall change in output divided by the change in input.</em>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>As you know, one way to calculate the slope of a straight-line function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> is to pick two different values for the input: call the larger of them <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and the smaller <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Think of these input values as the endpoints of an <strong><em>interval</em></strong> or <strong><em>neighborhood</em></strong> of the domain. The length of this domain is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Evaluate the function at those endpoints and calculate the slope simply as the difference in output divided by the length of the interval: <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}\]</span></p>
<p>“Slope” is a natural metaphor when thinking of a function as a graph. But a more general way to describe the concept is the <strong><em>rate of change</em></strong> of the output with respect to the input. The change in the output from one end of the interval is <span class="math inline">\(f(x_1) - f(x_0)\)</span>, the change in the input is <span class="math inline">\(x_1 - x_0\)</span>. If the input is time (in hours), and the output is the position of a car (in miles), then the rate of change is <em>miles-per-hour</em>: the car’s velocity.</p>
<p>For a straight-line function—think of a car driving at constant speed on a highway—it doesn’t matter what you choose for <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> (so long as they are not identical). But for other functions, the choice does matter.</p>
<p>Imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}. Over the course of an hour, the car travelled about 25 miles. In other words, the <strong><em>average</em></strong> speed is 25 miles/hour: the <em>slope</em> of the red line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car was stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D) and sometimes much faster than average (time B).</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/stop-and-go-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>During the interval from B to C, the car was travelling relatively fast. The slope of the brown segment connecting the position at times B and C is the <strong><em>average</em></strong> rate of change between times B and C. It’s easy to see that the average rate of change from B to C is larger than the overall average from <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span>. Calculating that slope is a matter of evaluating the position at the endpoints and dividing by the length of the interval.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>What is the average rate of change in the car’s position during the interval <span class="math inline">\(t_B = 0.40\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_C=0.54\)</span>?</p>
<p>The length of the interval is <span class="math inline">\(t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14\)</span>.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function gives <span class="math inline">\(x(t_C) = 18\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x(t_B) = 12.6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Rise is <span class="math inline">\(x(t_C) - x(t_B) = 18 - 12.6 = 5.4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Run is <span class="math inline">\(t_C - t_B = 0.54-0.40=0.14\)</span>.</p>
<p>The average rate of change during the interval is $5.4/0.14 = 38.6 $ miles/hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>The graph shows a simplified model of the amount of usable wood that can be harvested from a typical tree in a managed forest of Ponderosa Pine. (You can see some actual forestry research models <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr292/1992_milner.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/aver-tree-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>You are writing a business plan for a proposed pine forest. Among other things, you have to forecast the revenue that will be generated and when you will have salable product.</p>
<p>They say that “time is money.” Every year you wait before harvest is another year that you don’t have the money. On the other hand, every year that you wait means more wood at the end. How to decide when to harvest?</p>
<p>The tree continues to grow until year 50, when it seems to have reached an equilibrium: perhaps growth goes to zero, or rot balances what growth there is. There’s no point waiting until after year 50.</p>
<p>At year 25, the tree is growing as fast as it ever will. You’ll get about 600 board-feet of lumber. Should you harvest at year 25? No! That the tree is growing so fast means that you will have a lot more wood at year 26, 27, and so on. The time to harvest is when the growth is getting smaller, so that it’s not worth waiting an extra year.</p>
<p>The quantity of interest is the average rate of growth from seedling to harvest. Harvesting at year 25 will give a total change of 600 board feet over 25 years, giving an average rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(600 \div 25 = 24 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}\)</span>. But if you wait until year 35, you’ll have about 900 board feet, giving an average rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(900 \div 35 = 25.7 \mbox{board-feet-per-year}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We’ve been presenting the average rate of change as a <strong>number</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}\]</span></p>
<p>But it’s helpful to think of it as a <strong>function</strong> that takes two inputs, which we can call <span class="math inline">\(t_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\text{ave_rate_of_change}(t_A, t_B) \equiv \frac{f(t_B) - f(t_A)}{t_B - t_A}\]</span>
This is a very subtle maneuver. The formula is exactly the same, but by writing the quantities <span class="math inline">\(t_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span> as inputs (by putting them in parentheses on the left side), we turn the formula into a function.</p>
<p>Sometimes the average-rate-of-change function presents the information in a clear way.</p>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>Back to the forest … Here’s a graph of the average-rate-of change function. The function has two inputs, but botany dictates that we can only be growing word from the time the seedling is planted. So we’ll set <span class="math inline">\(t_A = 0\)</span> and look at the corresponding <em>slice</em> of the function:</p>
<div class="inline-figure">
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="672">
The graph makes it clear that the maximum average growth from planting to harvest will occur at about year 32.</div>

<p>The car’s speedometer shows the speed at each moment—or <strong><em>instant</em></strong>—of the trip. As you can see in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}, the speed varies and is sometimes less than the average speed, sometimes greater, and occasionally equal to the average speed over the trip. The general term for the kind of quantity presented by the speedometer is the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> of the position function with respect to the input to that function.</p>
<p>Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} shows the instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/instant-speed-1.png" width="672">
The two graphs in Figures @ref{fig:stop-and-go} and @ref{fig:instant-speed} show exactly the same car trip. The presentation of the data in the different graphs makes it easy to see some things and hard to see others. For instance, figuring out when the car is at a stand-still is harder in the position-vs-time graph than in the speed-vs-time graph. This is very much in the spirit of the sand-furrows example at the start of this chapter: it’s much easier to perceive the furrows because the lighting highlights areas sloping toward the sun as bright and areas sloping away from the sun as dark. In Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} we’re not using light-and-dark for the display. Instead, we’re showing the instantaneous speed using the vertical axis.</div>
<p>Recall that the interval between <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_C\)</span> had an <strong><em>average rate of change</em></strong> of about 39 miles-per-hour. Looking at the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> tells the story differently: at time <span class="math inline">\(t_B\)</span> the car was accelerating to about 60 miles-per-hour. Then it gradually slowed, coming to a stop just before time <span class="math inline">\(t_C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go} shows the function <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{position}(t)\)</span>. Figure @ref{fig:instant-speed} shows a different function, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{speed}(t)\)</span>. Although the two functions are different, they are intimately related: <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{speed}(t)\)</span> is the <strong><em>instantaneous rate of change</em></strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{position}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two central operations in calculus are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given a function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, find the function <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> giving the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>. This process of deriving <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is called <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Given a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span>, find the <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> of which <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> is the instantaneous rate of change. This process of finding <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> is called <strong><em>anti-differentiation</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="workedexample" latex-data="">
<p>The context of the situation being modeled determines whether it’s appropriate to look at an average rate of change or an instantaneous rate of change. Figure @ref{fig:instant-tree} shows the instantaneous rate of change in the volume of wood.</p>
<p><img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/instant-tree-1.png" width="672">
It’s tempting to look to the year where the growth rate is highest as the optimal harvest year. This is a mistake. The volume of wood being harvested is the <strong><em>accumulated growth</em></strong> not the instantaneous growth. Even though the instantaneous growth is higher at year 23 than year 30, it’s still pretty high at year 30 and waiting until then (or later) accumates those years of higher-than-average growth. That’s why the <strong><em>average rate of growth</em></strong> is a better thing to look at to determine optimal harvest time. Still, is it the right thing to look at?</p>
<p>Between year 30 and 32, there is hardly any change in the value of the average-rate-of-change function. It’s increasing a little, but is it really worthwhile to wait? One argument is that at year 29 you already have a valuable resource: wood that could be money in the bank. If the money were in the bank, you could invest it and earn more money <em>and</em> at the same time get a new seedling in the ground to start its growth. You’re doing two things at once. Efficient!</p>
<p>To know what is the best year for harvest from this point of view, you want to calculate the effective “interest rate” on the present amount of wood that you earn in the form of new wood. That interest rate is the ratio of the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of growth of new wood divided by the amount of existing wood. Figure @ref{fig:tree-interest} shows this function:</p>
<div class="inline-figure">
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/tree-interest-1.png" width="672">
Early in the tree’s life, the growth is high compared to the volume of the tree. That’s because the tree is small. As the years pass, the tree gets bigger. Even though the rate of growth increases through year 23, the accumulated volume increases even faster, so there is a fall in the rate of return.</div>
<p>The best time to harvest is when the annual “interest rate” paid by the growing tree falls to the level of the next best available investment. Suppose that investment would pay 10% per year. Then harvest the tree at year 24. If the next best investment paid only 5% (blue horizontal line), the harvest should be made at about year 29.</p>
