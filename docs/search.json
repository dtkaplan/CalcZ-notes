There are other ways of presenting functions that have other advantages, such as speed of evaluation, computer readability, and the ability to perform computations that ***derive a new function from the original***. If you have studied calculus before, you know the word \"derivative,\" which is all about a particular kind of new function created from an original. We'll get to this in good time along with other ways of \"deriving\" new functions from old.\n\nLet's look carefully at some formats for organizing the parts of a function.\n\nConsider the function $$g(x) \\equiv m x + b$$ You already know:\n\ni. $g()$ is the name we've given to the function. The name is the choice of the modeler. \nii. $(x)$ indicates that there is one input to $g()$ and that we are going to call this input \"$x$\". \n    a. The parentheses are simply punctuation.\n    b. If we wanted a function with two inputs, we would need two different names inside the parentheses and would separate them with a comma: e.g. $h(x, y) = a_0 + a_x x + a_y y$.\niii. $m x + b$ is a ***formula*** in traditional mathematical notation. So is $a_0 + a_x x + a_y y$. \n    a. Note that there is no equal sign in a formula; a formula is **not** an equation!\n    b. The formulas we've seen so far can be evaluated with arithmetic. But often a formula will involve the invocation of another function. For example: $\\sqrt{\\strut m x + b}$ or $\\sin(m x) + \\ln(b)$.\n    \n    \nIt's helpful to generalize the idea of a formula a bit. An ***algorithm*** is a set of instructions for performing a computation. High-school math typically involves presenting algorithms as formula. You learned, maybe in middle school, how to follow the arithmetic steps involved in algorithms described as formulas. You also have likely used a calculator to perform some of the arithmetic or to evaluate functions such as $\\sin()$ and $\\ln()$ and $\\sqrt{\\strut}$ for which you don't know how to evaluate using simple arithmetic. The calculator is implementing an algorithm with which its been programmed to enable the calculation of $\\sin()$ and $\\ln()$ and such.\n\nMany functions are described by algorithms that use concepts common in computer programming but unknown to traditional mathematical notation. Some of these have names like ***iteration*** or ***branching*** and many refer to stored lists of fixed numbers (like the office workers in the street, building, floor, corridor, door image of a function). We'll deal with some of these things later, but for now ...\n\n> We are going to use the word ***algorithm*** to name the kind of expression to the right of $\\equiv$ in a function definition. A ***formula*** is a specific kind of algorithm generally written in traditional math notation.\n\nAlgorithms, including the ones that are formulas, are written in terms of a set of ***symbols*** that stand for inputs. This is a high-fallutin' way of saying something simple: in $mx + b$, the $x$, $m$, and $b$ are the names we give to the quantities being used in the calculation.\n\nThe notation we are using for function definition lists some of these names in two places, and others in only one place. Again, look at $$g(x) \\equiv m x + b$$\nThe $x$ appears both in the algorithm and the list of input name $(x)$ to the left of $\\equiv$.\n\nThe $m$ and $b$ are different; they appear **only** in the algorithm. The word for such quantities in mathematics is ***parameter***. Eventually, when the algorithm is followed, we're going to have to put in specific numerical values in place of each parameter. \n\n**Where will these parameter values come from?** This is a subject on which mathematical notation is silent. You have to figure it out from context and experience. This is potentially very confusing, especially when a human is not around to sort things out.\n\nFortunately, the notation used in computer programming does not have this flaw. Depending on the language things can be handled in one way or another. For experienced computer programmers: This is the issue of ***scope***. In the software used in CalcZ (R, with the `mosaic` package of extensions), we will take a simple-to-use approach that avoids your having to deal with scope. \n\nIt works like this: \n\n> All modeling functions we construct with R/`mosaic` will list parameters formally as ***arguments*** to the function.\n\nIt is as if we wrote in traditional notation $$g(x, m, b) \\equiv m x + b$$\n\nThere is also a way to give default numerical values to parameters so that you can write $g(3.5)$ and the computer will know where to find the parameter values. In writing about formulas using math notation, we'll extend the traditional notation to write, for instance, $g(x, m=2, b=3) \\equiv m x + b$.\n\nIn R/`mosaic`, we would construct a mathematical function like $g()$ using the `makeFun()` function:\n\n```r\ng <- makeFun(m*x + b ~ x, m=2, b=3)\ng <- makeFun(m*x + b ~ x)"},{"path":"the-basic-modeling-functions.html","id":"the-basic-modeling-functions","chapter":"4 The Basic Modeling Functions","heading":"4 The Basic Modeling Functions","text":"","code":""},{"path":"modeling-with-functions.html","id":"modeling-with-functions","chapter":"5 Modeling with functions","heading":"5 Modeling with functions","text":"central task solving problems mathematical modeling construction appropriate functions capture important features real-world situation working . ’ve seen notation ’re going use describe functions either computer mathematical reader, learned terminology: function name, inputs, output, arguments, argument names, parameters, default values parameters, algorithm, makeFun(), tilde expressions, .next step developing modeling skills acquaint set basic modeling functions provide important building blocks functions construct mathematical modeling work.
