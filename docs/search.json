Skills essential work engineering science, highly valued many fields commerce, management, government. Often, work applying quantitative skills called calculation. name calculus used describe methods widely used undertaking calculations.Functions fundamental way organizing mathematical models calculations. undoubtedly seen previous mathematics education, ’s worth reviewing basics can share vocabulary communicating .function transformation one inputs output.keep things simple now ’ll focus inputs outputs numeric, later ’ll need nuanced view “numeric” takes account different kinds things represented numbers, e.g. length, power, RPM.see functions work, imagine long corridor sequence offices, identified room number. input function room number. evaluate function input, knock appropriate door , response, ’ll receive piece paper number take away . number output function.sound first simple true, … mathematical function office gives exactly number every time someone knocks door.

Imagine office building many parallel corridors, numeric ID. evaluate function, need two numeric inputs: number corridor number door along corridor. two numbers hand, locate appropriate door, knock receive output number return.Three inputs?

Three numbers corresponds point space, perhaps organized (x, y, z) Cartesian space. higher-dimensional spaces, usually special training needed become comfortable . discomfort, might prefer work office metaphor. Just fun, ’s can think 10-dimensional space: 10 numbers, one telling planet, next specifying continent planet, country, state, city, street, building, floor, corridor, door.set inputs function can evaluated called domain function.

Sometimes domains including restrictions. instance, particular input might meaningfully positive, offices corresponding negative values input. , input might restricted interval 0 1.
