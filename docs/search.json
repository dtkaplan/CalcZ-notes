Develop an understanding of the relationship you want to model. Often, part of this \"understanding\" is the pattern seen in data.\n2. Choose a function type---e.g. exponential, sinusoidal, sigmoid---that you think would be a good match to the relationship.\n3. Find parameters that scales your function to be able to accept real-world inputs and generate real-world outputs.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between two basic types of model:\n\n1. ***Empirical models*** which are rooted in ***observation*** and ***data***.\n2. ***Mechanistic models*** such as those created by applying fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such.\n\nWe are going to put off mechanistic models for a while, for two reasons. First, the \"fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such\" are often expressed with the concepts and methods of calculus. We are heading there, but at this point you don't yet know the core concepts and methods of calculus. Second, most students don't make a careful study of the \"fundamental laws of physics, chemistry, and such\" until *after* they have studied calculus. So examples of mechanistic models will be a bit hollow at this point.\n\nWe'll start then with empirical modeling: finding functions that are a good summary of data. The process of constructing a model that is a good match for data is called ***curve fitting***, or, more generally, ***fitting a model***.\n\n## Variations from scaling\n\nA good place to start building a model is to pick one of the basic modeling functions. This works surprisingly often. To remind you, here are our nine ***pattern-book*** functions:   <span style=\"float: right; padding-left: 50px;\"><a name=\"910\" href=\"#910\"><img src=\"www/icons8-signpost.png\" title=\"Location: 910\" width=\"12px\"/><\/a><span style=\"color: red; font-size: 6pt;\">910<\/red><\/span>\n\n\n\n<!-- the official list of pattern-book functions and their names -->\n\nPattern name | Traditional notation       |  R notation\n------------|---------------------|--------------\nexponential | $e^x$               | `exp(x)`\nlogarithm (\"natural log\")  | $\\ln(x)$            | `log(x)`\nsinusoid    | $\\sin(x)$           | `sin(x)`\nsquare      | $x^2$               | `x^2`\nproportional| $x$                 | `x`\nconstant    | $1$                 | `1`\nreciprocal  | $1/x$ or $x^{-1}$   | `1/x`\ngaussian (\"hump\")        | $\\dnorm(x)$         | `dnorm(x)`\nsigmoid     | $\\pnorm(x)$         | `pnorm(x)`\n     \nThe basic modeling functions are the same, but replace the plain $x$ in the pattern-book function with a straight-line function, for instance $ax + b$ or, equivalently $a(x - x_0)$.  In use, the parameter $a$ is often written with some other letter and, often, the $b$ or $-x_0$ part is not needed. \n\n\nHere are some of the common forms of the basic modeling functions you will encounter:\n\nName | Common forms | note\n-----|--------------|------------\nExponential | $e^{k t}$ or  $e^{-k t}$ or $e^{-t/ \\tau}$\nSinusoid | $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{P} (t-t_0)\\right)$, $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{P} t\\right)$, or $\\sin(\\omega t)$ | $P$ is \"period\", $\\omega$ is \"angular frequency.\"\nMonomials | $[x-x_0]$ or $[x-x_0]^2$, and so on\nPower-law generally | $x^p$ or $[x-x_0]^p$ | $p$ is \"power.\"\nGaussian | $\\dnorm(x, mean, sd)$ | Interpret \"mean\" as \"center.\"\nSigmoid | $\\dnorm(x, mean, sd)$ | $sd$ is \"standard deviation\" or \"spread.\"\n\n\n\nIt helps in making the selection to have ready to mind the basic shape of each of these function families. To review, revisit Section \\@ref(function-shapes).\n\nRemember also that, in general, we scale the inputs and scale the output. This means that in choose a model family, we don't have to worry at first about the numbers on the axes. (Of course, those numbers will be critically important later on in the process!) The scaling does, however, allow us to consider some variations on the shapes of the modeling functions. In particular, the ***input scaling*** lets us flip the shape right-for-left. And the ***output scaling*** lets us flip the shape top-for-bottom.\n\n- $f(t)$, basic shape\n- $f(-t)$, flipped right-for-left\n- $-f(t)$, flipped top-for-bottom\n- $-f(-t)$, flipped both top-for-bottom and right-for-left\n\nFor functions such as the sinusoid, flipping is not much use, since the flipped sinusoid curve is still a sinusoid, although with a shifted input.

Instructors focus topics can assessed successfully resources hand. practice means topics answers either right wrong possible generate new assessment questions easily.

Integration functions. many important widely used function types algebraic solution problem integration. Yet every function can anti-differentiated. , good technique anti-differentiating function readily hand via numerical techniques similar Euler method. methods implemented pretty simple R function: antiD(). Consider antiD() learning use fourth method integration, one much easier either u-substitution integration parts. Since antiD() can handle comers, algebraic methods can handle small (hard predict) set functions, terms using anti-derivatives, antiD() highest priority , , adequate integration. algebraic methods integrating basic modeling functions give vocabulary need communicate huge majority people learned calculus traditional, algebraic way. U-substitution integration parts bring marginally along, nearly far along computer algebra systems even traditional printed handbook called “table integrals.” 3935Finally, learn statistics, way take sample fundamental importance whether get faithful representation process. calculus textbooks (even MMAC text), sample integration problems highly influenced relatively ease instructors generate new never--seen functions can anti-differentiated using u-substitution integration parts. ’s safe say never encounter functions professional uses calculus. (Uses teaching calculus, !) 3940If difficulty using u-substitution integration parts, league vast majority calculus students. Think fellow students master topic way think ice dancers. ’s beautiful watch, hardly solves every problem. People fall face strapped pair skates nonetheless made huge contributions technical fields, even involve ice. (Prof. Kaplan heart--heart 2009 Nobel-prize winner confessed always feeling bad inadequate scientist done well introductory calculus. nominated Nobel felt comfortable admitting “failure.”) Even don’t master u-substitution integration parts, remember can integrate function using easily accessible resources. 3945We’ve devoted third block accumulation algebraic techniques calculating anti-derivatives. see techniques use future classes work science engineering. 3950It’s nature things people master algebraic techniques many . ’s easy make mistakes.
