<p>The questions that started it all had to do with motion. There were words to describe speed: fast and slow. There were words to describe force: strong and weak, heavy and light. And there were words to describe location and distance: far and near, long and short, here and there. But what were the relationships among these things? And how did time fit in, an intangible quantity that had aspects of location (long and short) and of speed (quick and slow)?</p>
<p>Galileo (1564-1642) started the ball rolling. As the son of a musician and music theorist, he had a sense of musical time, a steady beat of intervals. When a student of medicine in Pisa, he noted that swinging pendulums kept reliable time, regardless of the amplitude of their swing. After accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he turned to mathematics and natural philosophy. Inventing the telescope, his observations put him on a collision course with the accepted classical truth about the nature of the planets. Seeking to understand gravity, he built an apparatus that enabled him to measure accurately the position in time of a ball rolling down a straight ramp. The belled gates he set up to mark the ball’s passage were spaced arithmetically in musical time: 1, 2, 3, 4, …. But the distance between the gates was geometric: 1, 4, 9, 16, …. Thus he established a mathematical relationship between increments in time and increments in position. Time advanced as 1, 1, 1, 1, … and position as 1, 3, 5, 7, …. He observed that the <strong><em>second</em></strong> increments of position, the increments of the increments 1, 3, 5, 7, …, were themselves evenly spaced: 2, 2, 2, ….</p>
<p>Putting these observations in tabular form, and adding columns for the</p>
<ul>
<li>first increment <span class="math inline">\(y(t) \equiv x(t+1) - x(t)\)</span> and the</li>

<p>Galileo had neither the mathematics nor the equipment to measure motion continuously in time. So what might be obvious to us now, that position is a function of time <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>, would have had little practical significance to him. But we discover in his first increments of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> something very much like the <strong><em>slope function</em></strong> in Chapter <a href="#slope-function"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_t\, x(t) \equiv \frac{x(t + 1) - x(t)}{1}\]</span>
From his data, he observed that <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\, x(t)\)</span> increases linearly in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_t x(t) = 2 t + 1\]</span></p>
<p>Calculating the second increments of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is done by the “slope function of the slope function,” which we can call <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_{tt}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_{tt} x \equiv {\cal D}_t \left[{\cal D}_t x(t)\right] = 2(t+1) + 1 - (2 t + 1) = 2\]</span>
## Continuous time</p>
<p>Newton considered the problem for continuous time rather than Galileo’s discrete time. He reframed the slope function from the big increments of the slope operator <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\)</span> to imagined vanishingly small increments of a operator that we shall denote <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\)</span> and call <strong><em>differentiation</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The kind of question for which Newton wanted to be able to calculate the answer was, “How to find the function <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> whose second increment, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{tt} x(t) = 2\)</span>?” His approach, which he called the “method of fluxions,” became so important that its name became, simply, “Calculus.”</p>
<p>Over the next three centuries, calculus evolved from a set of techniques for describing motion into the general-purpose mathematics of change. Applying calculus in the real world involves understanding change relationships between quantities. To give some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical power is the change with respect to time of electrical energy.</li>
<li>Birth rate is one component of the change with respect to time of population.</li>
<li>Interest, as in bank interest or credit card interest, is the change with repect to time of assets.</li>
<li>Inflation is the change with respect to time of prices.</li>
<li>Disease incidence is one component of the change with respect to time of disease prevalence.</li>
<li>Force is the change with respect to position of energy.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">16.1</span> Slopes and motion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#slopes-and-motion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Chapter <a href="fun-slopes.html#instantaneous-rate-of-change">9.6</a> introduced the idea of a <strong><em>slope function</em></strong>: a function <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> whose value at each instant gives the instantaneous rate of change of a partner function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>. To keep easier track of the relationship between the function and it’s slope function, we use the <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}\)</span> notation:
<span class="math display">\[{\cal}D_t f(t)\]</span> is the slope function of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate, imagine a graph of the position of a car along a road as in Figure <a href="change-relationships.html#fig:stop-and-go2">16.1</a>. Over the course of an hour, the car traveled about 25 miles. In other words, the <strong><em>average</em></strong> speed is 25 miles/hour: the <em>slope</em> of the red line segment. Given the traffic, sometimes the car was stopped (time C), sometimes crawling (time D) and sometimes much faster than average (time B).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/stop-and-go2-1.png" alt="The position of an imagined car over an hour of time. (black) The red line shows what the position would have been if the car had travelled steadily at the average speed for the hour." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 16.1: The position of an imagined car over an hour of time. (black) The red line shows what the position would have been if the car had travelled steadily at the average speed for the hour.
</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, when you’re driving you are aware of the car’s speed at any instant. You need only look at the speedometer to read off the value (in miles per hour). Speedometers don’t show the average speed for the entire trip. The average speed is the slope of the red line in Figure @ref(fig:stop-and-go2}, 25 miles in one hour, usually stated 25 miles-per-hour.</p>
<p>In terms of Figure @ref(fig:stop-and-go2}, the speedometer reading is the <strong>slope</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> at the given instant. You can see from the Figure that at instant A the speed is very close to the average speed for the entire trip. At instant B the car is going faster; the slope is much steeper. On the other hand, at instant C the car is at a standstill; its position doesn’t change at all.</p>
<p>The car’s speedometer shows the speed at each moment—or <strong><em>instant</em></strong>—of the trip. As you can see in Figure @ref{fig:stop-and-go}, the speed varies and is sometimes less than the average speed, sometimes greater, and occasionally equal to the average speed over the trip.</p>
<p>Although you can easily judge whether the instantaneous speed is faster or slower than the average speed, quantifying the speed requires some work: calculating the slope of the tangent line.</p>
<p>Far easier to have this job done for us. The means to do so is to compute the slope function of <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_tf()\)</span>. Figure <a href="change-relationships.html#fig:instant-speed">16.2</a> shows <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_tf()\)</span> directly.</p>
<p>You can read off the speed from the graph at any instant simply by reference to the vertical axis.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span id="fig:instant-speed"></span>
<img src="CalcZ-notes_files/figure-html/instant-speed-1.png" alt="The ***instantaneous*** velocity of the car whose position vs time is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:stop-and-go2)." width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 16.2: The <strong><em>instantaneous</em></strong> velocity of the car whose position vs time is shown in Figure <a href="change-relationships.html#fig:stop-and-go2">16.1</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The two graphs in Figures <a href="#fig:stop-and-go"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="change-relationships.html#fig:instant-speed">16.2</a> show exactly the same car trip. The presentation of the data in the different graphs makes it easy to see some things and hard to see others. For instance, figuring out when the car is at a stand-still is harder in the position-vs-time graph than in the speed-vs-time graph.</p>
<p>Having worked out a theory of slope functions, Newton was ready to express the laws of motion in continuous time. He did this by denoting position as <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>. The familiar concepts of velocity and force could then be defined in terms of slope functions of position and the “quantity of matter,” which we call “mass.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Velocity is the slope function of position: <span class="math inline">\(v(t) \equiv {\cal D}_t x(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Net force is the slope function of velocity times mass: <span class="math inline">\(F(t) \equiv m {\cal D}_t v(t)\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To take mass out of the formulation, we give a name specifically to the slope function of velocity; we call it <strong><em>acceleration</em></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceleration is the slope function of velocity: <span class="math inline">\(a(t) \equiv {\cal D}_t v(t)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With acceleration as a concept, we can define net force as mass times acceleration. This is better known as <strong><em>Newton’s Second Law of Motion</em></strong>.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>We used <strong>net force</strong> as the quantity we related to mass and the slope function of velocity. There are different sources of forces which add up and can cancel out. Famously, Newton formulated the <strong><em>law of universal gravitation</em></strong> which ascribed the force between masses as proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. But a mass on a table has no net force on it, since the table pushes back (push = force) on the mass to cancel out the force due to gravity. “Net force” takes such cancellation into account.</p>

<p>Notice that in (1) and (2) above we didn’t use the <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\)</span> notation. It’s time to switch away from that. What prompts the change is the nuisance of the constant 0.1 in the definition of the slope function:
<span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_t f(t) \equiv \frac{f(t+0.1) - f(t)}{0.1}\]</span></p>
<p>Whereas the slope function <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t f(t)\)</span> gives an approximation to the instantaneous rate of change, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t f(t)\)</span> refers to the instantaneous rate of change <strong>exactly</strong>.</p>

It’s a subject of particular interest to mathematicians, hence a central part of traditional calculus texts (which are mostly written by mathematicians).

<p>As an intermediate step on the path between <span class="math inline">\({\cal D}_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_t\)</span>, let’s redefine the slope function to eliminate the 0.1 and replace it with a parameter <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x f(x) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span>
This way of writing the slope function will enable us to consider how the slope function changes as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> gets smaller and smaller.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">16.3</span> Notations for differentiation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notations-for-differentiation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are several traditional notations for differentiation of a function named <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span>. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leibnitz: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{df}{dx}\)</span>
</li>
<li>Partial: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\)</span>
</li>
<li>Euler: <span class="math inline">\(D_x f\)</span>
</li>
<li>One-line: <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f\)</span> (a hybrid of partial and Euler notation.)</li>
<li>Newton (or “dot”): <span class="math inline">\(\dot{f}\)</span>
</li>
<li>Lagrange (or “prime”): <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, we will mainly use the one-line notation, <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x f\)</span>, but it means exactly the same as the Leibnitz and Partial notations, which are much more widely used in textbooks.</p>
<p>If you’ve studied calculus before, you have likely seen the <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> notation. This is admirably concise but is only viable in a narrow circumstance: functions that take a single input. What <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> leaves out is a means to specify a crucial aspect of differentiation, the <strong>with-respect-to variable</strong>. The general situation for differentiation involves functions of one or more variables, for example, <span class="math inline">\(g(x, y, z)\)</span>. For such functions, you need to specify which is the with-respect-to variable. For instance, we can differentiate <span class="math inline">\(g()\)</span> three different ways, each way incrementing one or another of the three inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\partial_z g(x, y, z) \equiv \frac{g(x, y, z+h) - g(x, y, z)}{h}\\ 
\ \\
\partial_x g(x, y, z) \equiv \frac{g(x+h, y, z) - g(x, y, z)}{h}\\ 
\ \\
\partial_y g(x, y, z) \equiv \frac{g(x, y+h, z) - g(x, y, z)}{h}\]</span></p>
<p>At this point in your studies, you haven’t seen why you might choose to differentiate a function with respect to one variable or another. That will come in time. But we want to set you up with notation that won’t narrow your options.</p>
<p>Both the Leibnitz and Partial notations are explicit in identifying the function and the with-respect-to-variable. For example, using the Partial differentiation notation, the three ways of differentiating our example function <span class="math inline">\(g(x, y, z)\)</span> are labeled :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\ \ \ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y},\ \ \text{and}\ \ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\]</span></p>
<p>Our R/mosaic computer differentiation is longer but explicit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb130"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">dx_g</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">g</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">y</span>, <span class="va">z</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>The names being used here are arbitrary; you can use any names you like. What’s nice about <code>dx_g</code> and the others is that it mimics the math notation <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x g()\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that the R/mosaic operator for differentiation is named <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> and that it is a function. It follows the same pattern as <code>makeFun()</code> or <code>slice_plot()</code> or <code>contour_plot()</code>: the first argument is a tilde expression, for instance <code>g(x, y, z) ~ x</code>, which identifies the mathematical function to work with (<code>g()</code>) and the name of the with-respect-to input to that function. The R/mosaic notation makes it clear that differentiation is an <strong><em>operation</em></strong> on a function. The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> operator takes a function as input and produces as output <strong>another function</strong>. We’ve seen similar behavior with, say, <code>slice_plot()</code>, which takes a function as input and produces graphics as output. Both <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> and <code>slice_plot()</code> need to know the identity of the with-respect-to variable as well as the function to work with. What’s why both pieces of input are packaged into a tilde expression.</p>
<div class="why">
<p>We’re calling <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/deriv.html">D()</a></code> an <strong><em>operator</em></strong> rather than a <strong><em>function</em></strong>. The reason is purely for communication with other people. There are so many “functions” in a calculus course that we thought it would be helpful to distinguish between the kinds of functions that take quantities as input and produce a quantity as output, and the functions that take a <em>function</em> as input and produce a <em>function</em> as output. Both sorts are called “functions” in R terminology. But a sentence like, “Differentiation is a function that takes a function as input and produces a function as output,” true though it be, is dizzying.</p>
</div>
<div class="intheworld">
<p>It is a fact of mathematical and scientific life that a variety of notations are used for differentiation. To some extent, this reflects historical precedence and, to be honest, nationalistic European politics of the 18th century. To make sense of mathematical writing in the many areas in which calculus is used, you have to recognize all of them for what they are. Your skill will be enhanced if you also memorize the names of the different styles. It’s not all that different from the pattern in English of having multiple words for the same sort of object, for instance: car, automobile, junker, ride, wheels, crate, jalopy, limo, motor car, horseless carriage.</p>
<p>In the days when carriages where pulled by horses, the phrase “horseless carriage” made a useful distinction. Today, when horses are rarely seen on the road, it make sense to trim down the notation to its essentials: <del>horseless</del> <strong>car</strong><del>iage</del>. Think of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x\)</span> as this sort of minificat
ion of older notations.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Yes, “minification” is a word!&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<details><p>Recall that a function is <strong><em>monotonically increasing</em></strong> on a given domain when the function’s slope is positive everywhere in that domain. A <strong><em>monotonically decreasing</em></strong> function, similarly, as a negative slope everywhere in the domain.

<p>Recall that the differencing operator takes as input a function and returns as output another function that takes the same kind of input, but produces a different kind of output.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/pressure.html">pressure()</a></code> takes an altitude as input (in km) and returns as output a pressure (in kPa, “kiloPascal”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Air pressure at sea level is about 100 kiloPascal.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>19</sup></a>).</p>
<p>The derivative function, let’s call it <code>d_pressure()</code>, also takes an input in km, but produces an output in kPA per km: a rate.</p>
<p>You can see this by examining the differencing operator itself:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x f(x) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span></p>
<p>Remember the notation for dimensions. A quantity <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has dimensions denoted as <span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span>. (This is nothing more than saying, “Pronounce ‘<span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span>’ as ‘the dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.’”)
The input to <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> has dimension <span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span>. The output from <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> has dimension <span class="math inline">\([f(x)]\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>? (We could write this question more simply, "What is <span class="math inline">\([h]\)</span>?) Since the operator adds <span class="math inline">\(x + h\)</span>, it must be that <span class="math inline">\([h] = [x]\)</span>. Otherwise, addition wouldn’t be a viable operation to combine the two quantities.</p>
<p>What is the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(f(x + h) - f(x)\)</span>? (Again, we could ask this more simply, “What is <span class="math inline">\([f(x+h) - f(x)]\)</span>?”) Since we’re subtracting two quantities, the two quantities must have the same dimension and the result is also that dimension. So <span class="math inline">\([f(x+h) - f(x)] = [f(x)]\)</span>.</p>
<p>The output of the function <span class="math inline">\(df(x)\)</span> produced by <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Diff}(f)\)</span> therefore has dimension <span class="math inline">\([f(x)] / [x]\)</span>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">16.5</span> Visualizing the slope function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#slope-fun-visualization"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The function produced by the differencing operation
<span class="math display">\[{\cal D}_x f(x) \equiv \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]</span> is in every way an ordinary function that takes an input and produces an output.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, we visualize functions of one variable by drawing a <strong><em>graph</em></strong>. This technique is every bit as applicable to functions produced by <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x}\)</span> as to any other function.</p>
<p>The input to a slope function <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} f(x)\)</span> is exactly the same as the input to the mother function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. So a graph of the slope function will have the same <strong>horizontal axis</strong> as a graph of the mother function. However, the output of <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} f(x)\)</span> is a different kind of thing than the output of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that we have a mother function <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span> giving atmospheric temperature at a location on Earth as a function of altitude <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The output of <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span> has, as you would expect, the dimension of temperature with units of, say, degrees C. But the output of <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} T(x)\)</span> has a different dimension: temperature divided by altitude with units of, say, degrees C per km.</p>
<p>The different dimensions of the output of a function and the output of its slope fun means that the <strong>vertical axis</strong> for graphing <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} f(x)\)</span> must be different from the vertical axis used for graphing <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. Thus, in general, <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> cannot be graphed in the same frame.</p>
<p>This requirement to use different graphics frames for <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x}f(x)\)</span> makes it somewhat difficult to visualize the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x}f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s explore a non-standard way to visualize <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x}f(x)\)</span> that can be shown in the same graphics frame as the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. Perhaps this non-standard visualization will give you a better way to understand slope functions. If so, good. The ultimate benefit of a way to show <span class="math inline">\(\diff{x} f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> in the same frame will come when we introduce the operation of <strong><em>anti-differentiation</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Recall that the <strong><em>basic model of change</em></strong> in Calculus is the straight-line function <span class="math inline">\(\line(x) \equiv a x + b\)</span>. The slope <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\line(x)\)</span> tells how the output changes for a unit change in input. In differentiation, we</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>approximate the mother function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> as a series of local line segments.</li>
<li>extract the <strong>slope</strong> of each line segment as the value of the slope function at each input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure <a href="change-relationships.html#fig:segment-approx">16.3</a> shows the segment by segment approximation around each of several input values (marked in green). The <strong><em>slope function visualization</em></strong> is constructed by throwing away the vertical offset of each of the line segments and plotting them horizontally adjacent to one another.</p>
