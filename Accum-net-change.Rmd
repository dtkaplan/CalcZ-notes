# Accumulation as net change {#net-change}

The derivative function $\partial_t F(t)$ tells us, for any input $t$, what was the ***instantaneous rate of change*** of some mother function $F(t)$. Suppose $F(t)$ is the position of a car along a city street, perhaps measured in miles from a marked starting point. The car, slowing down, stopping, and speeding up in traffic, has a velocity (instantaneous rate of change of position) that changes in time, so $\partial_t F(t)$ will have different outputs for different values of the input $t$.  `r mark(3500)`

By accumulating $\partial_t F(t)$, that is, by anti-differentiation, we recover $F(t)$. The value of $F(t)$ at any $t$ tells us the amount of distance covered by the car since ... well, since when? Since the beginning of the month? Since the morning? Since the car was first manufactured? Any of these questions might be legitimate for some purpose or another, but we need to be careful about using $F(t)$ to make sure that the result we get answers the question that's relevant. So after we've built $F(t)$, we need to be specific about the answer to "Starting from where?" `r mark(3505)`

An important way in which the anti-derivative is used involves specifying the "Starting from where?" input. Let's call this $t_a$. Perhaps our interest in accumulating the velocity is to know how far we've traveled since starting on the present trip. So set $t_a$ to be the start time.  `r mark(3510)`

The word "net" has several meanings, including a means of fishing or trapping butterflies. Here, our use of "net" reflects the usage in **accounting**. The net of a quantity is that quantity minus some deduction. Without taking into account the deduction, the quantity is called a "gross" quantity. For instance, you can find the gross weight of a bottle of pickles by putting the sealed bottle on a scale. The resulting gross quantity might be important to a trucker who has to carry a load of 10,000 such bottles. But to the consumer, the weight of the pickles themselves is what matters. So from the gross weight subtract the weight of the brine and of the glass in the bottle. This gives the ***net*** weight.  `r mark(3515)`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="32 ounces of pickles (net) come in a package with a larger gross weight that includes the brine and bottle."}

```

The position at $t_a$ can be written as the accumulation up to $F(t_a)$. The **net** distance traveled up to time $t$ is then the difference $$F(t) - F(t_a)$$ our position now at time $t$ minus our starting position.  `r mark(3520)`

As it happens, every car has a feature to display the anti-derivative of the velocity evaluated at the current time. The speedometer reads off the instantaneous velocity; the anti-derivative is shown on the odometer. You're about to set out on a trip and want to keep track of how far you've gone. So you look at the odometer at the start and write that down. Later in your trip, to know how far you've gone, read the odometer again and subtract the value you wrote down at the start. $F(t) - F(t_a)$. `r mark(3525)`
