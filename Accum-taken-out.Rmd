Remembering that accumulation is the opposite of differentiation, let's invert differentiation. The setting is that we know $\partial_t f(t)$ but do not yet know $f(t)$. Recall the familiar form of derivative, approximated by
$$\color{blue}{\partial_t f(t_0)} \equiv \frac{f(t_0+\color{blue}{h}) - f(t_0)}{\color{blue}{h}}$$
We've put the quantities we know in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>. We know the derivative $\color{blue}{\partial_t f(t)}$ and we have selected some $\color{blue}{h}$. (In the population example, we set $\color{blue}{h}$ to be 1 year.) Re-arranging the above formula gives:
$$f(t_0+h) = \color{blue}{f(t_0)} + \color{blue}{h} \times \color{blue}{\partial_t f(t_0)}$$
Notice that we're saying we know $\color{blue}{f(t_0)}$. This is just like saying that we knew the population in year 2020; we know where we start.

The formula allows us to find $f()$ at time $h$ in the future. That is, we compute the unknown $f(t_0 + h)$ from what we already know.

This projection into the future using the (known) rate of change is called an ***Euler step***. The idea of inverting differentiation is to take one Euler step after another, constructing the future values one after the other
$f(t_0 + h)$, $f(t_0 + 2h)$, $f(t_0 + 3h), \cdots$. After each step, we know something more about $f()$ which we can use in taking the next step. For instance, once $f(t_0 + h)$ has been calculated, we get $f(t_0 + 2h)$ by applying the Euler step formula:

$$f(t_0 + 2h) = \color{blue}{f(t_0 + h)} + \color{blue}{h} \times \color{blue}{\partial_t f(t_0 + h)}$$
Notice that we've written $\color{blue}{f(t_0 + h)}$ in blue. Although we didn't know $f(t_0 + h)$ at the very start of the process, we figured it out by the first Euler step and it's ready for use in the second step.
