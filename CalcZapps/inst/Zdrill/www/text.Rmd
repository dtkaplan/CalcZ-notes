**D1** Which of these has dimension \(L^2\)? [Dimension]

[+] Acre [That's right]
[] Mile  [That's just \(L\).]
[] Light year  [A length, not an area.]
[] Foot candle  
[] Foot pound  [This is torque, not area.]

**D2** What is the dimension of energy? [Dimension]

[+] M L2 / T2  [Force times distance]
# comment line
[] \(m c^2\)  [This isn't a dimension, it's a quantity. But it's useful to remind you of what the dimension of energy is. \(c\) has dimension L / T]
[] \(L^2 T^2 / M\) 
[] L T / M [\(\int_0^3 dx\)]

**D3** Which planet are we on? [Debugging]

[] Mercury  [Too close to the sun for me!]
[] Venus [Still too hot, although I guess it's due to CO\(_2\)]
[a] Earth [Home, sweet home]
[] Mars [In the movies, maybe]

**D4** How many days in a week? [Debugging]

[] 1 
[] 3 
[] 5 
[a] 7 ["Sabbath" comes from the Hebrew word for "rest," but it's quite close to the word for "seven."]
[] 9

**D5** How many hours in a day? [Debugging]

[] 12
[a] 24
[] 36
[] 48

**Dback1** You are given \(\partial_x\,f(x) \equiv 0\). What is \(f(x)\)? [Basic-Derivatives]

[] \(f(x) \equiv b\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + b\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + b x\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a x + b\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + b x^2\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a x^2 + b\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + b x + c x^2\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + b x + c x^2 / 2\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + 2b  x + c x^2\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a + 2b x + c x^2/2\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a x + b x\)
[] \(f(x) \equiv a x^2/2 + b x^2/2\)
